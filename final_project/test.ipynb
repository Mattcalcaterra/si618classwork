       "  'review': 'This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.\\n\\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\\n\\n* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.\\n\\n* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.\\n\\n* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.\\n\\n* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.\\n\\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\\n\\n* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. \\n\\n* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it\\'s almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.\\n\\n* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don\\'t often line up well. My metro station might say \"100 per week\" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n\\nIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.',\n",

       "  'review': \"In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \\n\\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\\n\\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \\n\\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.\\n\\nSome of the things worth noting:\\n- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.\\n- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.\\n- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.\\n- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.\\n- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.\\n- This list just goes on and on...\\n\\nThe only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.\\n\\nJust a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :P\\n\\nTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.\\n\\nFind my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'For 2 weeks I debated purchasing [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] (I\\'m sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, \"screw it\" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.\\n\\nIn a nut shell, [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b] [/i]goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You\\'re required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.\\n\\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\\n\\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\\n+ Replayability value is here 100%\\n+ Sound effects are great and very life-like\\n+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you\\'re able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, [i]Colossal[/i]!\\n+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle\\n+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though\\n+ The \"basic\" version of [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the [i]Deluxe Edition[/i] unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer\\'s further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshop\\n\\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\\n± DLC\\'s are a bit pricey and I\\'m not sure if it\\'s really worth it. In the end, it\\'s your call \\n\\n[b][u]Update 26 May, 2016: I\\'ve finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC\\'s and I\\'ll provide a brief breakdown.[/u][/b]\\n \\n[i][b]After Dark[/b] DLC[/i]: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I\\'m just confusing something!\\n\\n[i][b]Snowfall[/b] DLC[/i]: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. \\n\\n[i][b]Verdict[/b][/i]: In my opinion, the DLC\\'s are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer\\'s as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I\\'d say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC\\'s are cheaper (I\\'d say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC\\'s completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you\\'re an achievement hunter like me, then you\\'ll need to purchase the DLC\\'s. \\n\\nIf budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting [i]After Dark[/i] first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it\\'s far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven\\'t even really played with [i]Snowfall[/i] since it doesn\\'t offer much beyond its name. It\\'s completely up to you!\\n\\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\\n- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)\\n- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful\\n- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you\\'re looking to upgrade them\\n- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)\\n\\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\\n\\nAll in all, [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I\\'ve already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I\\'ve exited the game. If you\\'re into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.\\n\\nWith an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can\\'t go wrong with this title. Bravo, [i]Colossal Order[/i] and [i]Paradox Interactive[/i], bravo: thank you for this amazing game.\\n\\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\\n9.5/10\\n\\nIf you have any questions, please don\\'t hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!\\n\\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Update 11 June, 2016[/b]: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, [i]Colossal Order[/i] - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.\\n\\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\\n\\n[h1]Worthy Questions & Answers[/h1]\\n1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I\\'ve done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn\\'t stop me from getting on this game though!\\n2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn\\'t necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I\\'ve left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)\\n\\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1][b]Cities Skylines Review[/b][/h1]\\n                                    \\nIts been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.\\n\\nI have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.\\n\\nThere is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn\\'t just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. \\n\\nTransportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens\\' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.\\n\\nI could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The \"Chirper\" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game\\'s best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. \\n\\nIn fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.\\n\\n[h1][b]The Good:\\n========[/b][/h1]\\n[i]+  Solid graphics and rich detail\\n+  Realistic simulation elements\\n+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings\\n+  Variety of buildings\\n+  Many customization options\\n+  Easy-to-use UI\\n+  Extremely high replay value\\n+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included\\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\\n+  Pleasant audio/background music[/i]\\n\\n\\n[h1][b]The Bad:\\n======[/b][/h1]\\n[i]-  Lack of random events/natural disasters\\n-  Graphics could be more life-like\\n-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplay[/i]\\n\\n[h1][b]Final Thoughts:\\n===========[/b][/h1]\\nCities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.\\n\\n\\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is a truncated version of this video review:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJb7C2OE9xM\\n\\nIf you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.\\n\\nSkylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.\\n\\nAs is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.\\n\\nAnd thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.\\n\\nLet me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.\\n\\nAnd it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.\\nCities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way.  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.\\n\\nThis is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.\\n\\nFirst up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.\\n\\nThe gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.\\n\\nYou’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.\\n\\nThe game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!\\n\\nIndustries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb. \\n\\nThe game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.\\n\\nSurprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.\\n\\nNow you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?\\n\\nThe game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.\\n\\nThere is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.\\n\\nThe camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!\\n\\nNot a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.\\n\\nThere is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.\\n\\nSim City, eat your heart out.',\n",

       "  'review': \"So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.\\n\\nAll in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.\",\n",

I've collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most SimCity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy. When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.\\n\\nThen SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life. The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft =.=.\\n\\nSo long live Cities: Skylines. Long live Collosal Order. \\n\\n9/10\\n\\n[b]PS: Found a link earlier this week about Maxis and EA. Apparently EA is closing Maxis down. Give it a read. http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/04/its-a-sim-ea-closes-simssimcity-developer-maxis/ [/b] What do you guys think about this? Feel free to comment.\\n\\nAlso please keep in mind that the comments made on SimCity 5 are based on my experience with the game when it originally released and not patches and ammendments that have been made to the game since then.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.\\n\\n\\nMAP SIZE: 10/10\\nThe city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.\\n\\nAI: 7/10\\nThey all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.\\n\\nINTERFACE: 9/10\\nThe interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.\\n\\nHOW IT RUNS: 10/10\\nIt runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVoP1Um95Sg&list=UUZYqx1ak0C-YKhUQY6QtxDQ\\n\\nTHINGS TO DO: 9/10\\nThere is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.\\n\\nDIVERSITY: 9/10\\nThe only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)\\n\\nDIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10\\nThe only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.\\n\\nGRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10\\nThey are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.\\n\\nCLUTTER: 8/10\\nUgh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..\\n\\nPRICE: 10/10\\nFor this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE:\\n90% To Perfect\\nWould I recommend this? Yes!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Hi. I'm an asset creator for this game, which is to say I make custom Workshop content so people can have something interesting and different to look at in their cities. I am not the best asset creator for this game - but I really love doing it. \\n\\nIf Cities:Skylines didn't exist, I wouldn't have bothered to learn how to create 3D game assets and models, texture said models, nor would I have met some fantastic people who share the same interest. I've always loved city builders, all the way back since SimCity on the SNES - and this one really scratches that itch. The enthusiasm and diversity of this community can not be understated. As a Canadian, I've met people from the U.K., Kazakhstan, Russia, France, Japan, the U.S. - and some of my fellow countrymen - and all have shared that enthusiasm. In terms of a competent and accommodating community, Cities:Skylines is hard to beat.\\n\\nAs a city builder, it's competent. It is better than the latest SimCity (2013), which is part of the reason why this game did so well. But it's not without its flaws. The thing is, though, like all cult classic games, you won't have a reason to complain about anything until you're deep enough in to call yourself a fan.\\n\\nThe base game is worth the price of admission outside of a sale. You should experience it if you have any interest in city builders. As it is a Paradox published title, there is a considerable amount of DLC, which some, sometimes, including myself, find disagreeable. My recommendation here is to purchase the After Dark and Mass Transit DLCs at any cost and go for the Snowfall, Natural Disasters and Green Cities when you can get them at a good price. All DLCs add something worthwhile to the game - but After Dark and Mass Transit, to me, were the most beneficial to gameplay.\\n\\nAlso, if you decide to purchase - ensure you have a decent supply of RAM before loading up on custom content. The minimum requirement for the game is 4gb - but I would recommend 8 (16 or more, if you can afford it. It's a Unity thing.).\\n\\nThe grassroots nature of Cities:Skylines is its greatest virtue. It's one of those few striking games that really exemplifies 'We, the people.' It is so many things to such a diverse crowd.\\n\\nSo, if you're a builder type, and you're hedging on it, you have my recommendation.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Dang, 1,000 hours of Cities and I still have no idea what I am doing. \\nSounds familiar? This is you, too? Well then, that\\'s because Colossal Order has brought a new era to City building simulation. \\nBut they didn\\'t do it alone. I am not talking about Paradox Interactive only, I am talking about the community. \\nYes, this is one of those games, where the community not only kept this game very much alive to this day, but enriched and has even done a better job in some aspects than the developers themselves. \\n\\nSo what you see in Vanilla Cities in 2022, is not even close to the experiences you unlock with a little help from the Steam Workshop. Yes, yadda yadda, city building simulator, forget about the *cough cough* other ones , the games you used to play when you were little. Cities: Skylines takes the cake. But let\\'s talk about a few pointers before you put this one into your virtual shopping cart: \\n\\n- You just wanna play the vanilla game and chill away for a bit? You can absolutely do that, but if you\\'re enjoying yourself and also find yourself building a new city over and over again to \"do it right this time\", then please try out mods, you will not regret it. \\n\\n- Once you do that and suddenly your desk turns into a city building planner\\'s office, then commit to it. A new city is like a blank canvas for you to create and once you have created and you see everything working, you\\'re going to feel VERY satisfied. \\n\\n- Feeling all satisfied and stuff, do one thing for me as well: If you do dive into the workshop and try one or say five hundred out of the bazillion mods that exist: Do favourite and give a \"like\" to the creators, it\\'s only one mouseclick after all. These boys and girls spend their precious time to make beautiful and awesome stuff for you to use for free. The least we can do is show them our appreciation and try to help them improve if necessary. \\n\\n- Speaking of appreciation: You will notice that while the base game of Cities: Skylines is rated quite positively, most of the DLC\\'s and Content Creator Packs are often viewed as a \"mixed\" bag. \\nTo be clear: Yes, some DLC might not be for you and no, you don\\'t NEED to have them all. BUT (!) They do add more variety to the game, they do enhance the experience. Choose carefully which ones are for you and keep in mind that this game can entertain you for 1000\\'s of hours (as it has with me) and I am COMPLETELY fine with Paradox releasing several new DLC\\'s every year, along with the content creator packs. The pricing is mostly fair and I have so far not been disappointed. (That\\'s not to say there are no flaws or room for improvement!)\\n\\nI believe Cities will continue to rock for a few more years, until a successor is on the horizon to again lift city building simulation to the next level. A big, massive, huge thumbs up from me! \\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"I used to love this game. After the failure of SimCity this had appeared as the game I wanted straight from the beginning... but now I just can't bare to play it a second longer. The way Paradox runs this game is such a parasitic and greedy way. And that has to do with their DLC\\n\\nThe DLC is getting ridiculous. Paradox is really getting lazy on their work to milk as much money as they can out of their fanbase. Even the trailer video for their recent financial DLC shows their lazyness with how lackluster and boring it is. And the more they release these little content packs, the more you realize how much they've been setting this up from the start. You want a financial institution in your city management game? Well buy it as DLC. Want airports? Buy it as DLC. Want shipping and tourist boats? Buy it as DLC. Want to really design the industry in your city? Buy it as DLC. Want some cool tourism features in your city? Buy it as DLC. Want some universities in your city? Buy it as DLC. Want some night life for you city? But it as DLC. Want some weather system in your city? Buy it as DLC? Want catastrophes that have been a trope of city management games since Sim City? Buy it as a DLC.\\n\\nDLC DLC DLC DLC!!!\\n\\nI'm getting so sick of all these little bits of DLC. What happened to the older generations of games where a company sold maybe 3-4 expansion DLC at most that were a solid 20-40$ each, but individually had enough content equivalent to half of the base game?\\n\\nWe're at 330$ worth of DLC everyone, but don't worry. I'm sure they'll have a subscription service here soon like they've started doing for their other games as they continue to release more overpriced little micro DLC of content you'd expect to be apart of a simulation game by default.\",\n",

A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke? [/td]\\n [/tr]\\n [tr]\\n  [td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td]\\n  [td][h1]9.5[/h1][/td]\\n  [td]This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.[/td]\\n [/tr]\\n [tr]\\n  [td][b]Story[/b][/td]\\n  [td][h1]N/A[/h1][/td]\\n  [td]No story here, besides the one you mutter to yourself as you cut off your city's water supply.[/td]\\n [/tr]\\n [tr]\\n  [td][b]Multiplayer[/b][/td]\\n  [td][h1]N/A[/h1][/td]\\n  [td]No multiplayer in Cities: Skylines.[/td]\\n [/tr]\\n [tr]\\n  [td][b]Replayability[/b][/td]\\n  [td][h1]10[/h1][/td]\\n  [td]This nearly comes with the territory of city building games. They always call you back to try creating a different city, or try new ideas with your layout. Or perhaps unleash havoc on the city to just...see what happens. Take all that joy, polish it, and you have Cities: Skylines, at your beck and call.[/td]\\n [/tr]\\n [tr]\\n  [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\\n  [td][h1]9.6/10[/h1][/td]\\n  [td]If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods!

       "  'review': '22-01-2020 Paradox released an update that included their own launcher and updated EULA.\\nOnce you launch the game through the steam shortcut, it will install their launcher without consent, as malware behaves, and on finishing you are greeting by an updated EULA that states that they are collecting information (that they can\\'t get through steam) and share with their affiliates.\\n\\nSome of us who bought the game under the original EULA aren\\'t a fan, many more not of another launcher you need to launch through the steam launcher.\\n\"But you can just decline!\"\\nYou could, but then you are locked out of your copy of the game you bought plus all the dlc\\'s without the ability to stay on the last version befor this amended EULA.\\nBesides that, there isn\\'t even a decline button and for that matter, not even an accept one! \\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MCkxeWs.png\\n\\nIt is just f\\'ing amazing that Steam is allowing companies to distribute their own launchers that send people to their own stores without consequences.\\n\\nGreat game, but I will not tolerate this crap from Paradox.\\n\\nSmall change as I just saw the joke in it:\\nThis launcher isn\\'t \"spyware\", it\\'s actually ransomware (3 new EULA\\'s), lol\\n\\n\\n[quote=Azure;1742265551916933952]You\\'re completely welcome to post about the launcher, and give feedback no matter how harsh. We listen to all our players\\n\\nWe are deleting threads that are: \\n- Nothing but personal insults or threats\\n- Spreading misinformation, such as about the launcher being spyware. Debating whether I should just post the very short list of what things the launcher actually does track. The EULA is the exact same, you just have to re-agree to it. You can even see the date on it is years old [/quote]\\nWe agreed to the EULA in steam.\\nI will not agree to the EULA in a stand alone program that is installed without consent and definitely not wanted.\\nIt might not be spyware, but it\\'s definitely ransomeware as I can not access the game through the platform I bought it.\\nAnyone with a braincell knows you are going to patch that workaround the first chance you get, for obvious reasons.\\n\\n\\nYou changed the terms of the contract when we bought the game (5 years ago!) to require additional software to run it, now enjoy the ride you programmed and saw coming per the title of the patch note.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/discussions/0/1742265315845302132/?ctp=3#c1742265551916933952\\n\\n\\nEdit 31-0-2020:\\nThis launcher is now to stay: \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/eventcomments/1742265917492249834/?ctp=16#c1750147465519786462\\n\\nInstead of reverting this update that bricked the game for many players, they are sticking to it instead of fixing it internally and then try again.\\nThey made it very clear they don\\'t care about their customers.\\n\\nI would highly recommend to avoid any Paradox published games and if you must play them, go the \"unofficial\" route because what you buy is not what you keep and they will gladly fuck you over at any time.\\n\\nThe next EA cancer is officially here, so I vote with my wallet and horrible mouth to mouth advice regardig any of their titles.\\n\\n\\nPs; Steam doesn\\'t gives a shit either so consider buying from GoG instead of Steam for single player games.\\nOn a tiny little detour for all you future wannabe community managers, don\\'t be a jackass to your players, they will be one right back at you ;)\\n\\n//end',\n",

THANK YOU! \\n\\nBut you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud?     I am sure you are ;) \\n\\nYou’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work. \\n\\nKudos to everyone!!!\\n\\n[b]Q: Where am I going?[/b]\\n\\nA: Sorry, I have a city to build... goodbye!',\n",

It’s an addictive game that lets you unleash your creativity as an omnipotent mayor/deity, building the city of your dreams and controlling everything from the road hierarchy to the production chain. It offers a relaxing gameplay loop with fantastic simulation that makes your city feel [i]alive![/i] Every civilian, or ‘cim’, has their own life. They go to school or work, go shopping, visit friends, and go back home. They park, [i]visit[/i] parks, take public transport, or just walk or bike around. Just following a random civilian around to see what they get up to is a fun experience in and of itself!\\n\\nThe challenge of the game comes primarily from money management, zone planning, and traffic management. You’ll likely find yourself struggling to maintain a decent traffic flow, which is one of the main challenges of the game. However, you can play Cities: Skylines as you wish – enable ‘Hard Mode’ for a greater challenge or enable unlimited money and soil, and ‘Unlock All’, for an experience more akin to a sandbox game.\\n\\nCities: Skylines offers a variety of special buildings – clinics, hospitals, fire stations, police headquarters, and so on, most of which aren’t just cosmetic, serving actual purposes within your city. By purchasing some of the 62 DLC packs the game has to offer, you’ll be able to unlock even more content! For lists of the best DLCs, check out the [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/bestdlc]r/CitiesSkylines wiki[/url].\\n\\nIt’s never been more fun to create and manage a city than in Cities: Skylines, and better yet, the game has a fantastic modding community with thousands of amazing mods! Most of them are assests – mainly buildings that you can add to your game – but a lot of them affect gameplay or visuals. Some of the most notable mods include Traffic Manager: President Edition, Find It! 2, Move It, Prop Control, and Network Anarchy – all of which, and more, I would consider to be [i]essential[/i] mods. Click [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990104327][b]here[/b][/url] for my collection of essential mods.\\n\\nModding Cities: Skylines allows you to achieve so much more than the base game could ever offer, allowing you to achieve much smarter and realistic traffic, the ability to place any building you want anywhere, and more – not to mention assets that let you [i]truly[/i] build the city of your dreams. You’ll find an asset on the Workshop for almost any city or country you can think of, so by downloading assets, you’ll be able to create a truly Japanese, American, Scandinavian, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese (the list goes on…) city, not to mention the many originally crafted assets and assets inspired by films and video games.\\n\\nNow, one of the issues that I, and many others, have with this game is that it’s yet another game that suffers from ‘greedy developers syndrome’. Whilst most of the DLC is well-made, I’d also consider almost all the DLC packs to be too expensive, especially considering the sheer number of them. Some of the packs are quite necessary to have to get decent enjoyment out of the game – such as After Dark and Green Cities – whereas some are just collections of some assets and are not worth the price (mainly the ‘content creator packs’ – i.e., mods that aren’t free).\\n\\nA lot of the DLC packs contain content that should’ve been in the base game, and it’s a hard sell when the more expensive ‘Deluxe Edition’ of the game contains precisely [i]zero[/i] of the game’s DLC packs. Purchasing all of the game’s DLC, not including the game itself and not accounting for sales, would cost you 392 € (429 USD) at the time of writing this. That’s just too much. I’m someone who appreciates DLC in games, but not when it’s overpriced and excessive, especially when a good chunk of the DLC packs are just a few assets thrown together.\\n\\nIf you do decide to get this game, I would wait for a discount, and definitely get the DLCs that you want when they, too, are discounted. Get the New Player Bundle and other essential DLCs when it’s on sale – or the Cities: Skylines Collection if it has a [i]really[/i] good sale (otherwise, it’s far too expensive, at 344 € as of writing this.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n\\nCities: Skylines is a [i]fabulous[/i] city builder – arguably the best one out there, until the sequel comes out later this year. It’s a game that offers endless replay value, with an unlimited number of ways to build and maintain your city. It offers engaging and relaxing gameplay (until you get stuck with 41% traffic flow, that is) and, assuming you have at [i]least[/i] six of the best DLC packs, offers a lot of content to keep the gameplay engaging.\\n\\nNegatives include expensive and excessive DLC, somewhat frequent bugs (although most of them visual), and relatively outdated graphics, but for a city builder, it still looks great! Ultimately, I would certainly recommend Cities: Skylines, especially if you’ve enjoyed games like SimCity in the past. Cities: Skylines is a highly polished, refined, and modern take on the city building game.\\n\\nHowever, if you’re willing to wait, I would recommend waiting for Cities: Skylines II. That game looks absolutely phenomenal – although you do have to expect that the game will be somewhat lacklustre content-wise at launch, especially considering that the developers stated that there won’t even be any bikes in the game upon release ([url=https://twitter.com/ColossalOrder/status/1668601581363757057?t=HQPDO98XmQa78g7G7kD77A&s=19]source[/url]).\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Cities: Skylines[/h1]\\n...is a city building simulator. Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account all DLCs.\\n\\n[h1]⚙ [u]Game Description & Mechanics[/u] ⚙[/h1]\\nIf you ever played a game from the [i]SimCity[/i] franchise, you\\'ll feel right at home. After selecting your map and preferences, you begin from a highway offramp from which you lay your first road, which will include buildable areas on either side (as permitted by the terrain). You can either zone for residential, commercial and industrial buildings to pop up, or build specific utility and city service buildings. You must also make sure that buildings have access to electricity (electricity is shared across a short radius, or can be transported further away by laying power lines) which will require constructing a power plant, and water/sewage (combine pipes are laid underground) which have separate water intake and waste outtake facilities.\\n\\nAs your population grows, you unlock additional buildings and services, but your citizen\\'s expectations will also grow. While the first citizens will make due with electricity, water and access to places where they work and shop, the first milestone will unlock elementary schools and garbage dump along with the citizen expectations that kids must have access to early education and that garbage disposal is available. The following milestone will unlock police and firefighter stations, and your citizens will expect you to supply them with these services. Further milestones include new road types, public transport, city policies, high-density zoning, and the possibility to increase the area of the map you can build on. Each time you unlock a milestone, you\\'re also given a cash grant, allowing you to quickly implement the new services, or at least get your head of the water if you were having a hard time with your finance.\\n\\nCity planning also includes multiple layers of district management. City districts allow you to implement city policies (low-traffic area, industrial specialization, zone-specific tax raises or reliefs, etc.) on an area without it being citywide. Park districts allow you to free-build parks (city park, nature reserve, theme parks or zoos) instead of relying on pre-built flat parks. Industrial district opens the option of digging into the nitty-gritty aspects of resources gathering and production-chain management of the core industries (agriculture, forestry, ore and oil). Educational districts allow you to establish large campus-style higher education facilities with all the faculty, varsity sports, and other services found in the world\\'s best colleges and universities. But as overwhelming as this sounds, districts are entirely optional, and can reasonably be skipped by new or casual city builders.\\n \\n[h1]☺ [u]What I enjoyed[/u] ☺[/h1]\\nThe game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. The milestone-unlocking is specifically meant to introduce newcomers to new gaming concepts gradually, while also allowing veterans to focus on the important aspects of a city and somewhat keep some realism over what a mayor can do (since approval and elections aren’t a factor). A much as I would like to build a subway system or a nuclear power plant in my 500-citizen village, it totally makes sense that I can\\'t and should instead focus on making sure they have access to drinkable water (which also means that water being pumped in shouldn\\'t be downstream from where my sewage is being pumped-out!).\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to forget [i]Colossal Order[/i]\\'s experience with [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/]Cities in Motion[/url][/i]! Transportation is at the forefront of city planning and expansion. You have dozens of types of roads: streets, boulevards, highways, some with one, two, three, even four lanes! Or perhaps some of those lanes are reserves for buses, or for bikes? Public transport is offered in a huge variety of flavors, and while some or redundant and you won\\'t need them all, the fact is that they offer the option. Do you want the freedom and simplicity of city buses? Maybe the extra carrying capacity of trams is more to your liking? Perhaps an overhead monorail to free up the streets? How about those ferries to carry your folks across the river or along your canals? Cable cars will get you up those hills and mountains hassle-free! I\\'m barely scratching the service and skipping intercity transports for passengers, tourists, and the import or export of goods and raw material.\\n\\n[h1]☹ [u]What bothered me[/u] ☹[/h1]\\nWhile innovative on release, the agent-based system feels pretty primitive by today\\'s standards. Cars all attempt to travel using the shortest route possible, ignoring any concept of traffic. What\\'s the point of building a four-lane highway when all the cars will pile up in the left and right lanes to make it to their exit, regardless of how many ways there are to travel around that specific out ramp? You may build a nice, convenient, high-speed highway around your city, but people might just drive across the low-speed residential streets with dozens of intersections because it\\'s the most direct route. You might have miles-long lines of cars and trucks, preventing emergency services from ever making it on the site of a crime or a fire. Any service you can\\'t plan routes for, such as garbage trucks or hearses, will fill up within the next few streets, never making it to the rest of the city, no matter whether they are well within coverage distance.\\n\\nZoning and constructible areas are limited to square tiles, but the layout of those tiles are tied to the streets. If you build nice, curved roads in your city, these tiles will be spread irregularly, so you can forget any forme of building density, and forego having 4x4 houses unless the streets are perfectly straight. This is something even [i]SimCity 2013[/i] knew to address, having its tiles compress or stretch along the road curves to make sure plots of lands weren\\'t separated and made inefficient. Also, except for pre-built buildings, you cannot choose which street a zoned area\\'s building will be facing. I dread building houses and stores on corners, as they will often face the wrong street than the one I intended. Terrain height is also mismanaged, a building defaulting at the height of the street they are facing, while its parking space might get painted on a curved cliff to its side. There are a lot of small, minute details such as this that can get very irritating.\\n\\n[h1][b]Verdict[/b]: ★★★★★ - [i]\"Play this. Now.\"[/i][/h1]\\n\\nDon\\'t get fooled by the negatives, because [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/]Cities: Skylines[/url][/i] is the best, more complex and more complete city builder out there. Sure, its sequel is on its way and addresses some of the issues, but it will still have a long way to go to be packed with as much content as this game has had with all of its bite-sized DLCs released through years of development. Unless you just don\\'t like city builders, I don\\'t understand how anyone would want to skip this one!\\n\\n—————————————————————————\\n[i][b]This was just my opinion.[/b]\\n\\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CJsOpinions/]reviews[/url].[/i]',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river\\n\\n- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.). \\n\\n- District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.\\n\\n- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.\\n\\n- Natural resource exploitation for more income.\\n\\n- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.\\n\\n- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.\\n\\n- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.\\n\\n- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.\\n\\n- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.\\n\\n- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.\\n\\n\\nI will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game.

       "  'review': \"Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.\\n\\nCities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.\\n\\nSimulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.\\nTraffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.\\n\\nThe economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.\\n\\nBuilding a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.\\n\\nDespite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.\\n\\nIf you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it\\'s roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.\\n\\nAnd while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.\\n\\nThe UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the \"best\" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn\\'t overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.\\n\\nPlanning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn\\'t surprsing given the developer\\'s history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn\\'t part of the Cities XL series). \\n\\nGraphics look good for the genre (don\\'t expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you\\'d expect, nothing really stands out, and it\\'s not annoying, fairly average. \\n\\nWhile the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I\\'m sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I\\'m sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn\\'t mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.\\n\\nPS: \\n\\nKill Chirpy.',\n",

(Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)\\n-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.\\n-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.\\n-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013)\\n-Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't like about this game so far?\\n\\n@Developers #The #twitter-like #announcements #and #the #constant #usage #of #hashtags (I get the point but I feel like my city is composed of preteens.)\\n\\nSo far and still hours later, 10/10.\\n\\n**EDIT 5/23/2015**\\nI've found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at r/citiesskylines and actually listen to their users.\\nDevelopers also cranked out FREE and well-done DLC, like it's supposed to be.\\nGame still kicks ass!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]⭐Review for Cities: Skylines[/h1]\\n[b]This game has fascinated me since its early days back in 2015. In a challenging way, it offers countless ways to build and manage your cities and is tremendously fun!\\nWhat makes this game so unique? The community, whose expansions keep the game alive in a sensational way![/b]\\n\\n\\n[u][b]🕹️The main game:[/b][/u]\\n\\n🧭You quickly get into the game and learn many useful things to create a nice looking scene in a short time. The difficult thing is to keep the city going. [quote=💬Paradox Interactive]Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master.  [/quote]\\n\\n⚖️Finding the right balance between important areas like education, public safety, health care, firefighting, water supply, electricity, economy and much more is definitely not easy. And the more the city grows, the more difficult it becomes to master these things.\\n\\n🚦In addition, there is the complex traffic simulation, which also needs to be closely monitored.\\nFor example, you can spend several hours designing and building a working highway exit. After a while, after you have expanded your city, built a new district, recruited more inhabitants, got the economy going, the exit you built does not work as it should, usually it just makes things worse and a newer, better solution is needed.\\n\\n💡This concept from the example above also applies to the other areas of the game.\\nWhat sounds frustrating at first is a real blessing for the game. It is motivating, challenges you and your thinking, and makes it hard to stop playing.\\n\\n💭I hope you understand what I am trying to say: You have so many possibilities and when you think you have finally done something right, it is disproved in the next moment and that\\'s what makes the game so exciting and challenging.\\n\\n\\n[u][b]🧩Expansions:[/b][/u]\\n\\n🔋Many games also develop so-called DLCs, which are usually intended to expand the players\\' experience. This is what the developers of \"CS\" do very well and have also really convinced the one or other time. Some of the expansions really stand out, others can be bought for a small pleasure, but are not really must-haves.\\n\\n🔎Here is just a brief overview and recommendation (more detailed information would require a separate review):\\n[table]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th]Name[/th]\\n        [th]X[/th]\\n        [th]Do I need this?

Well, the DLCs and other little expansions have their price...\\nIf you add it all up, you\\'ll easily get over 200 Euros. [i]Whether this economic strategy is good and ethically correct is not for me to decide, I know too little about it.[/i]\\nBut the good side: The purchases are of course optional and the important in-game changes come for free with the updates!\\n\\n\\n📢By the way, it comes with 9 different languages and thus also expands the fantastic community.\\n[list]\\n    [*]English 💂\\n    [*]German 🥨\\n    [*]French 🥖\\n    [*]Spanisch 💃\\n    [*]Polish 🥂\\n    [*]Brazilian Portuguese ⚽\\n    [*]Russian 👨\\u200d💻\\n    [*]Simplified Chinese 🥋\\n    [*]Korean 🏮\\n[/list]\\n[i]*Please do not feel offended by the emojis[/i]\\n\\n\\n[u][b]💪The Game Changer (Mods & More)[/b][/u]\\n\\n👀As you have seen, this game already has a lot to offer. But the incredible thing is that there is even more: the steam workshop and its community!\\n\\n⚙️Anyone who is familiar with programming can create mods for Cities Skylines and share them with anyone who owns the game. And WOW, some people would have done better as developers at Colossal Order. These players, who programmed mods in their spare time, have created real game changers. Actually, I don\\'t even want to play the game without such mods anymore, because they bring awesome additional features.\\n\\n🛠Besides mods, there are also assets that can also be created and provided by anyone. And WOW 2.0, there are some really unbelievable nice looking buildings, props, vehicles, streets, save games, maps, color corrections and much much more...\\n\\n📜In summary, this is the recipe of Cities\\' success and why the game is still very popular after almost 6 years. Constant development, new things, new features, for all areas and ideas. And if something is missing, create it yourself!\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[u][b]9/10✔️[/b][/u]\\n[b]Colossal Order has definitely created a masterpiece for us, which thanks to its community has been played by many happy gamers since 2015 and will surely remain so for a few years to come.\\n[quote=💬Paradox Interactive]You’re only limited by your imagination, so take control and reach for the sky![/quote][/b]\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[i]January 8, 2021\\n\\nYou liked my review or you have something to add/improve/another opinion?

       "  'review': \"This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it\\n+ Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it\\n+ Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads\\n+ The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler\\n+ Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system\\n+ Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city\\n+ Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime\\n+ Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop\\n+ Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback\\n+ Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod tools\\n\\nCons:\\n- It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality)\\n- The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption)\\n- Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)\\n\\nAll in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my \"capital of capitals\" - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it\\'s not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)\\n\\nThen came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - \"buy more of this, it will enhance the experience\". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.\\n\\nThen I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC \\'13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, \"Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?\" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!\\n\\nThe unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they\\'re functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it\\'s anything like New England winter, probably not too well!\\n\\nWhile there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it\\'s a lot larger than in SC \\'13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC \\'13...or any other type of game like this I\\'ve played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.\\n\\nIn short: Loads of fun, and it\\'s induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don\\'t burn me at the stake.',\n",

       "  'review': \"My people complained because taxes were too high, so I placed the water pumping station right next to the water drain pipe so they were forced to drink their own urine and feces. Within minutes, 97% of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people. I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero. Even through the apocalypse, he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived. Shortly after, he drowned in his own shit. RIP in peace Squidney Saxton, garbage man, 2015-2015.\\n\\nOn the bright side, my traffic problem went away.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh, look. I got Cities Skyline in my humble bundle. Not sure if I\\'ll like the game...\\n\\n12 hours later... \\n\\nJust gotta get a University down and THEN I\\'ll quit for the night.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Excellent Tools - almost everything is easy enough to use, but hard to master. Just like any good tool should be.\\n2. Visual Appeal - This game looks great! And it\\'s not a new game anymore.\\n3. Satisfying Mechanics - I normally dislike progression systems, but the ones here works well (with a few exceptions). The city logic makes sense. \\n4. Mods Mods Mods!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. It\\'s really, really dense. I had trouble with this game until I had a chance to play Surviving Mars. Then the mechanics \"clicked\" better. \\n2. Some systems could use a WAY better explanation in the early game. For example, it would be great to have a better idea that early road placement is critical to avoid early-mid game wall (of traffic).\\n3. Beginner mistakes mean lots of complete restarts. It can be frustrating. I recommend to bail at the slightest sign of trouble rather than trying to duke out a bad situation. \\n4. The simulation itself - There is a day and night, but \"night\" is multiple \"days\" long and it takes \"days\" for people to transport themselves just across the city in clear traffic. It\\'s weird, I don\\'t like it. \\n5. Traffic AI is abhorrent. Thank heavens it doesn\\'t simulate crashes. Designing roads in Vanilla (without mods) requires a different approach from real life. Intersections and complex road junctions should be avoided in favor of interchanges and merges. Even the suburban grid requires \"tricks\" to get working right.\\n\\n\\nDespite all the cons, I love this game. I just hope that the next iteration includes a much better tutorial and more accurate simulation.',\n",

       "  'review': 'With After Dark released, I can finally make a legit review for Cities: Skylines.\\n\\nCities is the most polished, realistic, best city building game I have ever played. Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best. \\n\\nCities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!',\n",

Or get them from a very large   Community Workshop right  here on Steam.\\nOver all I  do Highly Recommend this game. I give this game a 8.5 out of 10 Ratting.\\nNow I have been Playing PC games since the late 70's and this game is in my top 5 best game I have played in 40 years since I have been playing games.\",\n",

Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines! \\n\\nIts a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it! \\n\\nEvery new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population. And the tools I need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game. I'm having so much fun! :D\\n\\nDo I recommend this game? :D  Unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm.\",\n",

If you grew up playing sim games like simcity then most modern citybuilders are pretty aweful and I usually avoid buying games with dlc. However I was really surprised at how well rounded and detailed this game is. After almost 2000hours of my life to this game, it is one of my favorites. The industries dlc does need to be redone its really unbalanced, almost cheating, and supply/demand is just broken/nonsensical.

       "  'review': \"Once you start on Cities Skylines, say a heartfelt farewell to your free time. Loved SimCity 4? Buy this. You won't regret it. \\n\\nThis game has two sides. \\nOut of the box it is a fun, but somewhat repetitive after 100 hours, city simulation game. It'll still take up months of your time, but eventually all your cities will look the same.\\nThe mods is where the game truly becomes a masterpiece. Once you get the right mods, it truly becomes a giant sandbox. You'll be able to do everything from combine buildings to creating parks to the tiniest details, to combining thousands of props to create your own buildings from scratch right inside the game. Take a stroll around the city, hop on a bus... You can dream it, you can probably do it.  \\n\\nPro's: \\n- Various play styles. The developers included mods to enable Sandbox mode and Hard Mode, so you can choose how you wish to play. Want to play without money first, then turn money back on? Sure, just turn off the Unlimited Money mod! \\n- MODS. No, seriously, the mods make this game what it is. Between Move It, Plop The Growables, RICO, More Beautification, Anarchy mods and TMPE, this becomes a completely different game. You can do pretty much anything. \\n- Assets. The workshop is full of extraordinary assets, and it grows larger every day. \\n- The community is amazing. \\n\\nCon's:\\n- The game is build on the Unity Engine. This engine was not meant for simulation games, especially of this size. It doesn't support lazy loading, meaning all 81 tiles are all loaded and rendered at all time, and all assets (vanilla and custom) are loaded into the RAM for the entire duration of the game, whether you use them or not. As such you'll need a decent amount of RAM and a decent CPU to run the game. \\n- Traffic takes some thinking. Cims are abysmal drivers, and so just slapping down a few roads is not enough. You'll have to start learning a bit about how traffic works. There are Traffic AI mods that improve things, but they are quite CPU heavy. \\n\\nYes if: \\n- You're looking for a sandbox city builder where you can build whatever city you like. Grab a few mods and it becomes a virtual sandbox for you to play around in. \\n- You want a sequel to SimCity 4. \\n\\nNo if: \\n- You're looking for an in-depth socio-economic, demographic city management game. There is no political system.  \\n- You own a system with an IntelHD GPU. Just don't, it clearly says it's incompatible. Stop complaining the game doesn't work.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Have you ever played a game and wondered where the entire day went. That's Cities Skylines in a nutshell. There are so many ways to play this game there's not enough time or space in this review to do it justice. This game is perfect for creative types and those that like challenging game play. This game is a blast both modded and vanilla.\\n\\n I do recommend adding Mass Transit, After Dark, Parklife, Green Cities, and Industries DLC, in that order. Sunset Harbor is also a great addition to the game. If you like City Builders, you can not go wrong with Cities Skylines.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It’s hard to review a game that it’s constantly evolving like [b]Cities: Skylines[/b], so I will keep it short: If you enjoy SimCity, tycoons and management games, you will love Cities: Skylines. There’s so much to do, even with just the base game (which receives free content updates when a new expansion is released) and the DLCs are the icing on the cake. Yes, there are a lot of them, but you don’t need to rush to buy everything at once – each extra content can (and will) keep you occupied for a long time, so buy them little by little. \\n\\nIf I recall correctly, Cities: Skylines will receive new content until 2020, so there’s still room to grow, and the game is already [b]huge[/b], especially if you count thousands of workshop mods. I can’t recommend it enough – it’s a fun, relaxing and strategic experience that everyone should try at least once. You love classic games, right? This is one of those, and I’m sure it will be remembered with affection in the future.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is a pretty great game that is hidden behind shockingly predatory business practices. I bought this game near launch and really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to buy its first couple DLC packs. But eventually, more and more DLC came out. Today, even during a sale in which most of the DLC is 50% off, the remaining DLC would cost me well over $100, and most of these expensive DLC packs contain content that really should've been in the base game. Additionally, I want to echo many of the other complaints I'm seeing in reviews: 1) the new launcher is pointless and tacky, and 2) the new privacy policy that locks you out of the game if you don't wish to share all of your personal information with Paradox is pretty absurd and not a great way to treat fans.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The  two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods. \\n\\nWhat I love:\\nScale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city. \\n\\nLiving Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.  \\n\\nCities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game. \\n\\nWorkshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.\\n\\nNot so great:\\nDLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price. \\n\\nVanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.\\n\\nDifficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.\\n\\nTLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view  as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Best city building game out there[/h1]\\n\\nI can‘t really tell for how long i have waited for game like this. I always wanted to build a big city, manage it and what is most important feel that the city is alive. And this game delivers.\\n\\nAs in every game you start with nothing. You start building roads and zoning and people starting to move in. They require electricity, water and other services. After you provide people with everything they need the buildings start to level up and grow.  Step by step your little city becomes more beautiful with every year. After a while your city is full of skyscrapers and is busy 24/7. With the „After dark“ update you got the night/day cycles and it looks amazing. You just look at your city every night, it‘s so beautiful. Also you as a mayor can manage your city. Apply various policies to districts, like ban smoking, encourage biking or ban heavy traffic just to name a few. You can set the taxes for your residents and business and set the budgets of city services like garbage collection, electricity, water, public transport and a few dozen more.\\n\\nPeople in this game are not just pixels moving in random directions. Every person has a name, home and a job. He goes from his home to a job to a commercial district and back home. Every resident is simulated individually. Similar to Tropico series, but Cities skylines has much more to simulate.\\n\\nOf course like every game this one is no exception and has some flaws.\\nThe traffic is the most annoying. You will spend a lot of time managing the traffic, building and rebuilding roads. The previous game these developers have done is called Cities in motion and we can see it influenced Cities skylines, because required attention to traffic is a little too much. AI cars are stupid and don‘t know how to use lanes thus causing congestions. Of course every city has congestion problems and stupid drivers exists in real life too. So maybe it‘s not that bad, but anyway it could be better. Some mods can improve the traffic, but they don‘t change much. \\n\\nThe game lacks in management aspect. Yes you can manage your city but it lacks depth. It is too simple. I would like to have poor districts with bad education levels, where crime rate is high and police officers get shot often and you could apply some stricter policies over there or just leave them be in anarchy.\\n\\nGraphics in Cities skylines can be very beautiful, especially at night. Sometimes colors are off a bit, but all in all the game looks amazing. But this comes with a price. I get 25-30fps with GTX970 wich is not acceptable, but because it‘s not an action game i can live with that. I could lower some settings but i want my city look good, it‘s not an action game so it‘s playable at 30fps.\\nDevelopers support modding very much, the game has steam workshop full of mods. I doubt anyone is playing this game without mods. You can download cars, planes, trains, buildings etc. to beautify and diversify your city. Also there‘s color corrections, some gameplay improvement mods and many more.\\n\\nIf you like city building and management games this is a must have. And considering the price it‘s worth it even without a sale, you‘ll get hours of playtime from it. Do not expect much on economic side, but all the city building is done almost perfectly.\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Lets you build big cities\\n[*]Looks gorgeos\\n[*]Building themes lets you build a different looking city every time\\n[*]Mod support\\n[/list]\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Lacks depth in managing\\n[*]Dumb AI causing traffic problems\\n[*]Performance is not the best\\n[/list]\\n\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030]My curator page[/url]',\n",

       "  'review': 'Okay, I don\\'t usualy write reviews, but I chose to (this time).\\n\\nI love this game.  It\\'s one of the best city builders I have played within the past decade.  The other one is Cities XL, which I played heavily before Cities Skylies came out (unfortunately that game, Cities XL, is outdated and just wearing; not good for long play).\\n\\nThis game, however, if lively, bright, inviting, smooth, and fun.\\n\\nI know a lot of people have an issue with Paradox\\'s \"DLC policy\" but you\\'re not required to buy DLC to enjoy this game.  The game itself is fun and has updates on its own.  Also, the game is open to mods, which means you can add assets and other things created by other fans of the game from the workshop without having to worry about the DLC.\\n...and I wonder jsut how many people may argue about the DLC may have bought an expansion pack for an online game (WoW or any other,... Final Fantasy 14 in my case).  I can\\'t knock these worked on mini-expansions small prices when I spend $50 on an expansion for an online game that allows me to use 3 new jobs and travel to a new area...even thought I will be right next to people who can access these things without me having them (meaning the $50 was just a glorified unlock code, essentially)\\n\\nI mean they could wait and make a massive expansion and release a fullsized expansion but I don\\'t see the issue with sevelal small \"expansions\" called DLC.  DLC that one could wait until it goes on sale and buy them a bit along.\\n\\nAnd that is why I recommend this game.  A company that continually wants to expand on their property to keep it alive.  If you see it as them just being greedy, you\\'re not oblidged to buy it, but it\\'s clear that people are still buying them.  Why?  because they enjoy the game.\\n\\nThat\\'s the point of games.  To enjoy them.  Why not have more things added to further that enjoyment.  Much less have stuff added that is official, stable, and compatable.\\n\\nOr, if you\\'re not happy with it, you\\'re free to go buy the old and outdated city builders that avaiable on Steam here.  SimCity4 is available...but you\\'ll never get to see any new content or enjoy any mods with that game.',\n",

The experience is largely incomplete without DLCs and mods - see the list at the end of this review.\\n\\nAs with many games, you learn by trial and error plus some research. You might have to start completely over as you grow in your role of a city builder and realize your past mistakes. \\n\\nDuring my first 100 hours or so I scrapped a few cities. After each of them, there was a long break of not playing but eventually I always returned. Now, at the time of writing this, I have built my biggest city ever and still have a lot to achieve. This time, though, I\\'m confident that this city is worth sticking with until the end as all the major big-picture mistakes were done in my previous saves.\\n\\nThis game gives you that \"one more thing before I quit\" feeling quite regularly.

A big chuck of the former revolves around traffic and logistics. \\n\\nDLCs I\\'ve chosen:\\n- Mass Transit\\n- After Dark\\n- Campus\\n- Industries\\n- Sunset Harbor\\nYou can get all of these for a low price by buying activation keys.

       "  'review': 'Ahh, SimCity 5 *cough* Cities Skylines, As someone who has put over 150 hours into the game, I believe it is a good game.\\nIt is a very addicting after a few minutes due to it just having so many things to do. I have spent 12 hours without even knowing it spending time building a city. The DLC is a tiny bit expensive but I believe it is worth it. Overall I would rate it 8.5/10. The reason i give it a 8.5 is because of some aspects of the game, here are a few of them: No Seasons, Offices Not Having Enough Buyers, Performance Drops In Bigger Cities ( depends on your computer. ), etc. I hope this helps your buying decision.',\n",

       "  'review': 'More than 2 years I had the game in my wish list. Now I tried it on a test weekend, and it captivated me. Beautiful graphic, the challenge to create a well functioning city (I\\'m just saying traffic), many workshop stuff and included editors (for maps, themes, objects), and the sheer endless possibilities to build an awesome city.\\n\\nThe DLC policy is not as bad as some people write. Even the main game gets new stuff with every DLC, e.g. the release of the DLC \"After Dark\" enables the day/night cycle for everyone, even if you do not own the DLC.\\n\\nFor even more content, you should see which DLC you really need:\\n\\nThe DLC\\'s \"Green Cities\", \"Mass Transit\" and \"Snowfall\" add a lot of new things (maps, scenarios, buildings, means of transport e.g. trams (I like [strike]trains[/strike]  trams), etc.) and I can recommend so far.\\n\\nThe DLC \"Natural Disasters\" is something for players who want to see their city burn (or sink). (not for me)\\n\\nThe DLC \"Concerts\" adds some music, a festival area (with policies) and 3 associated buildings. Too small for the full price.\\n\\nThe DLC\\'s \"Synthetic Dawn Radio\", \"Country Road Radio\", \"All That Jazz\", \"Rock City Radio\" and \"Relaxation Station\" are just music. An alternative would be Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.\\n\\nThe \"Content Creator Packs\" are for people who don\\'t play any other game or want to support asset creators. An alternative is the awesome workshop.\\n\\nThe DLC \"Industries\" also adds a lot of content (specializations of the economy on 4 different branches with unique buildings and certain map requirements). That allows the player to build industry zones (or entire cities) only for agriculture, forestry, mining or oil industry. The associated products can be traded with the \"outside world\", or are used by other industries in their own city in small economic chains. Everything works without problems. The production and sale of special goods is an additional source of income for your city.\\n\\n[After ~83h playtime]\\nI LOVE this f***ing awesome game and I LOVE this f***ing awesome community for all this f***ing awesome assets and mods !\\n\\n[After ~90h playtime]\\nI bought extra more RAM to be able to use more assets (current ~1700) from the workshop (lower loading times and less stutters).\\n\\n[After ~221h playtime]\\n2090 assests and around a dozen of mods.\\nBought \"Park Life\" for the free creation of parks and \"Sunset Harbor\" for the fishing as a new industry.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]To honor this great game I deleted my old review and spend some time writing a new one.[/h1]\\n\\nYou should know that this game is a [u]long-term investment.[/u] You have to spend a lot of time on it fine tuning but in exchange you\\'ll get back a lot of excitement and room for creativity. You can start playing this game with [b]no knowledge[/b] about city builder games but you will soon notice that the larger you city gets the more challenging the road network becomes. \\n\\nAlthough you need a bit of patient or else you won\\'t like the game as much. You will have to bulldoze and rebuild streets sometimes multiple times. Just don\\'t see it as negative point and don\\'t get frustrated. Similar as if you draw a picture. \\nSince this is a city builder you will spend most of your time designing road layouts and managing traffic. \\n\\nNo one likes too much talking so here in short the positive and negative points.\\n\\n[u]Positive:[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*]great graphics. Subjective yes, but you can customize the colors (LUT). If you install the correct one it will look photo realistic instead of colorful\\n[*]easy to learn. Even if you\\'re a total beginner you will find fun in creating \\n[*]huge \"Wuselfaktor\" as we say in German. \"bustling factor\" might be the translation for it\\n[*]extreme high replay value\\n[*]awesome community with massive amount of mods on the workshop. I highly recommended to install at least the following must-have.\\n[*]low system requirements without mods\\n[*]low price for base game\\n[*]huge maps to build on\\n[*]different map themes\\n[*]Some content from DLCs is free for base game owners\\n[*]weather and day/night circle\\n[*]creating own districts and add policies\\n[/list]\\n[u]Negative:[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*]traffic sometimes doesn\\'t want to use up all lanes. Thankfully I don\\'t have this problem so often. There are multiple workarounds you can find, nevertheless it\\'s my only real critics point. I managed to avoid this mostly by using highway exits only on one side. (So there are 2 lanes in total for the main traffic and one for the off/on ramps) As of writing the review the developers rejected to ever fix it. As reason for this they state the increase of the system requirements needed. \\n[*]no real on/off ramps for highways (they are basically just one-lane highways)\\n[*]vanilla buildings without mods are a bit too repetitive\\n[*]expensive DLCs (for that little content they add. Nevertheless you support the developers and got a cheap base game. I got myself most DLCs by now on a sale)\\n[*]chirpy can get annoying ;)\\n[*]the following must-have mods should have been in the base game\\n[/list]\\n[u]Must-have mods:[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*][url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=766190099]Move it![/url] (Honestly my favorite one.

       "  'review': 'The base game is fairly ok, but it needs mods to really shine. Performance wise it\\'s quite CPU intensive, and the more workshop assets you enable, the worse the lag will get, and as such it\\'s in dire need of a good refactoring. I think the company will likely scratch it and make cities:skylines 2, rather than investing a ton of resources on this game\\'s likely bloated codebase.\\nThe bottom line is that you need a high-end computer,  and a good number of mods and workshop assets. \\nYou may also want a few DLCs which add a lot of additional gameplay options. IMHO these \"priority\" DLCs are:\\n* After dark\\n* Sunset harbor\\n* Industries\\n* Park Life\\n* Mass Transit\\n\\nThere are also some content-creator packs which (ironically) are much cooler (and useful) than paradox-made DLCs. For example, the content creator pack \"Train Stations\" gives you more options to create efficient and gorgeous train and metro hubs by adding train stations with 4 platforms and metro hubs which can handle 5 different lines',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Cities: Skylines; the best RAM-munching city sim you will ever play. (Reviewing full game + DLCs.)[/h1]\\nI am a massive fan of the genre of city building. From the classic greats like Sim City, to the more recent released, Cities: Skylines stands head and shoulder above the rest.\\n\\n[u]Game play[/u]\\nC:S is a massive city building sim with so many micromanagement opportunities your OCD will purr. You\\'ll start by creating districts of residential neighbourhoods for your \"happy\" people to live, of which they\\'ll constantly harass you via Chipper to be a better mayor. You\\'ll then choose what route of power you\\'ll provide, depending on what DLCs you have available. You can watch as you burn a hole in the ozone through coal, oil, or be upstanding and provide green energy. Same goes for water supplies and sewage; Want to watch a group of tourists swim in the sewage your city produces? Crack on.\\nIt doesn\\'t just stop there. Rubbish, recycling, postal services, healthcare, fire protection, crime prevention, education; you have complete control over how you want to govern. Each section allows an in-depth management in supply and demand, giving you full control. This has been expanded ten-fold with DLCs such as Campus, allowing you to tailor your own universities to give one example.\\nCreate jobs through office specialisations, retail areas, or offer more lucrative avenues such as specific industries and manufacturing. This has been expanded again by the devs via the Industries DLC, you\\'re able to create massive manufacturing chains starting from raw products, refine them and produce expensive exports to keep you in the black.\\nOne of by biggest joys in the game for me came from travel, and is so important in the game (especially when hitting a high population of 10,000+). You\\'re able to create and manage various routes and different types of transport (again expanded in the DLC \"Mass Transit\") to allow your citizens to freely traverse your city without clogging the main arterial roads of your city. This for me was the most difficult part of the whole game, one that I am still trying to master from well over 200 hours of gameplay.\\nLastly, C:S has one of the most active mod developers of any game that I have played. I am using many, many mods and custom assets that allow further improvement to gameplay, more customised buildings, better beautification tools, the list in endless. The active content creators are a joy to watch, giving you new play-style ideas, better ways of implementing tools, etc.\\n\\n[u]Graphics and Performance[/u]\\nI\\'m playing on an (albeit older) i7, with 16GB RAM and an older 4GB graphics card and I am still struggling  to achieve a full 60fps on a medium graphics preset (though I understand this can be down to the amount of custom assets I use), I am perfectly happy playing on this setting for the amount of processing that the game requires. It chews through RAM like you wouldn\\'t believe. Also loading times can also become a burden on lower graphics machines, again especially is using mods.\\n\\nPros:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Solid, endless gameplay, even without DLCs.\\n    [*]In depth but user friendly management systems.\\n    [*]Fantastic custom asset/mod creators/content creators.\\n[/list]\\nCons:\\n[list]\\n    [*]If you want to use multiple mods without damaging performance loss, ask your friend at NASA for their spare supercomputer or whatever.\\n    [*]DLCs are expensive, but worth it (apart from Natural Disasters, the DLC equivilent of a toddler having their sandcastle torn down by a bully)\\n    [*]The music can be quite annoying and differs in volume depending how zoomed in you are on the map, I personally turned it off.\\n    [*]The Chipper (the social media presence that allows communication from your population) makes you feel guilty about being a monster.\\n[/list]\\n\\nGreat game to relax with, wholly recommend if you have patience. 8.5/10',\n",

       "  'review': \"Despite my play time, recommending this game is tough, and in the end I just can't do it.\\n\\nOn one hand, Skylines is a fantastic game. While the comparison feels somewhat unfair since they took different approaches to gameplay, Skylines is everything people expected from the last SimCity game, and then some. It arrived with Workshop support baked in and there are thousands of mods, maps, and assets available to modify, expand on, or customize your experience.\\n\\nOn the other hand, after you reach a certain population point, the game becomes a traffic management simulator, so unless you understand how the AI works (or more accurately, how it does not) and start building to exploit/address these deficiencies, your cities will crumble. There are mods in the Workshop that I consider essential to working around vanilla limitations (Anarchy, TM:PE, Network Extensions, etc) that the developers either cannot or will not fix. \\n\\n[strike]Speaking of the developers, I have to give credit where it is due. Ignoring the limitations of the engine and terrible transportation and service AI, these guys bake the basic features of each DLC into the vanilla game, offering feature expansion at no cost. Not all the DLC is great, and while I support their approach, I'd really prefer they address the fundamental issues with the engine and AI instead.[/strike] Unfortunately, instead of doing this, they've expanded the game's ability to spy on users for marketing purposes. The change in EULA is alarming and this is a major factor in not recommending the game anymore. \\n\\nThe first impression is of a huge, expansive game with a plethora of options and systems to tinker with, in which you can build and run the city of your dreams. Once the shine wears off (3 years and 500 hours for me, slope was too steep on [i]perfectly flat, freshly leveled ground[/i]), you realize you're spending most of your time fighting [i]against[/i] the limitions or outright broken-ness of the engine and AI, all while the developers cannot or refuse to fix the fundamental flaws in their game but are more than happy to spy on and sell your personal information. Yep, that's right, supporting this game and developer means you're paying to be spied on now, instead of having the game you paid for fixed. Shame on you, Paradox and Colossal Order.\\n\\nTLDR: Get Skylines if you really like city building sims, because it's the best one available right now. Get it on sale, however, and don't bother with the DLC. With the EULA change Paradox and Colossal Order have demonstrated their lack of respect for the user base that supported the game and is now paying for the privilege of having personal information harvested while the game remains fundamentally broken.\\n\\nAdditional edit: Now Paradox has taken things a step further and forced their launcher on everyone, without their agreement or consent, and you can't access the game without it. You're also forced to accept the license agreement, external and separate from the platform it was originally purchased on. I consider the launcher malware since it didn't notify me it was installing and didn't ask for my permission first. I suggest everyone flag the launcher executable as malware in their AV software. This is an unwanted program, no potential about it.\\n\\nCongratulations, Paradox. Your users have been extremely vocal about not wanting this and you forged ahead and forced it on everyone regardless. You may think this is the best approach for your players, but you just guaranteed I'll never purchase any of your games going forward.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It is a very good game and probably worth buying.  It is the monetization of the game I have a problem with.  The game has 10 small DLC packs that all cost at least 13 USD, some more.  Small as in they add little and with a limited focus.  This probably wouldn't be a problem but becomes a problem with Cities Skylines without DLC and even with mods is rather poorly featured.  Nearly every aspect of the game feels underdeveloped and plain.  As if the game was created only to be the skeleton of platform to sell DLC rather than a great game with DLC adding on to it.  It feels very much like an ice cream cone, with no ice cream.  Paradox will spoon feed you ice cream one small flavor at a time but expects you to pay a premium for that ice cream.  The entire collection of DLC often goes on sale but even at 50% off it is tough to recommend and it is only going to get more expensive.\\n\\nIt is a great game but has no peers in terms of price.  Other studios now deliever the quantity and quality of content comparable to these DLC packs for free.  Which adds value to the purchase.  Cities Skylines does not add value but adds cost to aquire more than the bare minimum.  Paradox is not obligated to give anything for free but 133 dollars and counting while ON SALE is stupid no matter which way you cut the cake.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Cities: Skylines has become my favorite city building/management system game since the earlier Sim City games. Placed in a vast canvas you have the opportunity to build the city of your vision, but at a cost of demanding civilians wanting every single ounce of their needs met. This is a game challenging you the further you progress.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Plenty of maps to choose from (even more with the DLC)\\n- Realistic traffic flow, your city suffers if there are to many high traffic zones.\\n- The ability to separate policies per district is a huge plus.\\n- The city's leveling progression is a nice take on how well you're improving and also gifts you with funds.\\n- The building dynamics is easy to learn and also lets you remove the snap to grid feature to build roads however you want.\\n- Plenty of different buildings and community lots to build to assist the happiness of your citizens.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- I'm not a huge fan in the beginning of building a new city you are sort of forced to build off of a highway, I understand people need a port into the city, but if you do want to build off and away from the highway it can become expensive.\\n- Some of the citizens needs become tedious at times, especially during the later stages of a big city. The challenge is great, but at times you just see the little thought bubble and  you want to bulldoze that person's house.\\n- Even though I paid for all of the DLC, after thinking about the purchases some of the DLC content should be integrated into the game for free.\\n\\nDespite it all, I love this game. It can be relaxing when you take the city building process with its fair amount of challenge.  Compared to EA's latest Sim City game, Cities: Skylines buries it in all aspects.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities: Skylines (better known as Traffic: Jams) is a city planning simulator where you spend hours designing pretty intersections and city districts which work awfully wrong.\\n\\nThis game is a time waste sinkhole, honestly. When playing in the normal mode, your only goal is to grow the population of your city to unlock cool buildings. To do that, you draw roads and designate zoning for commerce, industry and residential areas and provide them with electricity, water and services such as fire station and police headquarters. Once reaching a certain threshold, you unlock further buildings. Nuclear power plant? Not before you reach 40,000 people, my friend! \\n\\nThe simulation aspects of C:S are very soft. Inhabitants need industries to work, industries need commerce to sell their good, commerce needs inhabitants to buy their stuff. It forms a cycle and that\\'s it. Industries pollute so you wanna keep them away from your residential areas, but you\\'ll have to be prepared to see their trucks going back and forth to the commercial areas. Your inhabitants will also use cars to get to places and that can create a true chaos if you don\\'t plan it correctly. They also use greedy algorithms (i.e. take shortest path) which is a key ingredient for traffic jams. The vehicles\\' AI don\\'t know how to properly use lanes which is quite frustrating. Luckily, there are mods which allow better control of those things.\\n\\nDon\\'t complain about traffic jam in C:S though, because if you do, someone will knock on your door to spread the word of the Road Hierarchy Theory and Proper Intersections Design [spoiler]which is much simpler than they believe and just half-solves the problems in C:S.[/spoiler]\\n\\nThe amount of cool mods is astonishing. The game also allows you to create custom assets from your own 3d models. I frankly spent more time in the assets editor than in the game itself!\\n\\nThe achievements are also much easier than they look. Playing with mods disable achievements and most of the community do not hunt them anyway. Some of the 0.2% achievements can be literally obtained in 5min. The only headache-inducing ones are: \\n- \"What the...\" requires a very random event, see here how to unlock it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2579860592\\n- \"1001 Nights\" requires playing the game for several lifetimes; the best way to get it is to let an empty city idling 24h a day for 7~10 days,  depending on your system.\\nLinux port was also perfect, thanks for supporting the penguin!',\n",

       "  'review': \"I am adding my update  review and video . Review is mostly unedited (though shortened) for posterity. \\n\\n[url=https://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/11/23/cities-skylines-review/] Full Review[/url] --  \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/dXL9aekqpL0\\n\\nI wasn’t sure what to expect when I booted Cities: Skylines.  After Cities in Motion, games that focused on mass transit as their first two games, I was almost definite I was going to have a bad time as I disliked both of those games on some level. \\n\\nA couple hours later I was a bit surprised because the hours flew by.  I’ve heard Cities: Skylines is a SimCity clone.  In reality, it’s a fantastic Simcity, far better than EA’s always online SimCity that they produced.  In fact, it’s released two years after the SimCity release and just is better in every way possible.  No online, great gameplay, and not as many really annoying bugs (such as traffic). \\n\\nThat’s the thing though, Cities Skylines is SimCity, if you hate the idea of city building, you’re probably not going to be happy here.  If you miss classic SimCity, this is a must own.  It’s not the same game, but it’s an excellent replacement for it, far superior in almost every way.\\n\\nThe big thing in Cities Skylines is the growth of the city ties to items. When your city is a village, you can only create certain objects.  Garbage is locked until you 440 people, The Police department is unlocked at 850 people.  Want a Solar Power Plant to be green?  Get 18,000 people and not a second before that.  It actually is a great way to scope the game and let you focus on tasks right in front of you than give you infinite choices and have you build stuff you don’t need but it can limit the game in the early game.  This might not be for everyone though.\\n\\nWhich is why there are mods, glorious mods!  The game ships with three mods if I remember correctly (I’ve gotten a lot since then), the Unlimited money mod, the unlock all mod, and the hard mode mod.  The unlimited money and unlock all mods both will unlock all buildings.  But there’s a LOT of mods for this game and a ton of great support through mods.  Basically, if you don’t like something in Cities Skylines there is a mod for it.  \\n\\nBut the building system does have one thing that’s quite cool.  There are unique buildings in which the player has to fulfill some minor or major task such as construct a certain type of building 30 times, or produce a certain amount of goods.  If you do that, you get a special building to customize your city with and give your city bonus usually a tourism, but they also help you build the big monuments which are awesome to aim for. \\n\\nSo it’s like a great version of SimCity, what’s different? \\n\\nWell, first there’s a number of tools that aren’t as good as others.  The road tool seems to hate perfect lines.  I want to draw perfect grids such as can be found in New York City.  Just long lines of perfect roads.  The road tool seems to hate me and I seem to fail at this often.  The roads do snap to each other at specific points, but I seem to miss the 90 degrees by a few degrees often.  I’m sure there’s some button to make these roads perfect but it should be easy to do this. \\n\\nI’ve tried to do highways and such and it’s sometimes a bit hard to make the connecting road matchup without an odd design. They’re just something not 100 percent right with the way it creates roads, not to mention curves. \\n\\nThe reason you want perfect roads is that the grid for the city has little squares, and anything other than a perfect rectangle gives you spaces in the grid or little gaps that don’t look too bad, but can limit growth They are minor breaks but they don’t look that good and the best buildings won’t be built there. \\n\\nZoning is well done though and it’s easy to throw down different types of building quickly, and replacing buildings with services don’t seem to hurt the neighborhoods much (The area around the service buildings, like a police station, recovers exceedingly fast.) \\n\\nThe game does add a fantastic tool that lets you build districts.  But what’s brilliant here, is you can paint the district, applying almost a blob to an area so you can make your own design and rename your districts what you want.  You can also change policies specifically for that area if you want.  It’s great to grow as you decide.  The management of these districts is far easier than I expected, but I’m not a micromanager.  I like to run “Freelandia!”  where you can do what you want.  However the micromanagement with the districts is fun, and it makes your city look great. I love naming areas with different names or recreating real places I have visited in San Diego, LA, Orlando, or of course Boston.  Or just name everything after body parts.  The choice is yours.\\n\\nI’ve always loved city building, and the experience of just watching a city grow, and that exact experience is here.  It takes some time but eventually the player gets an idea how to figure out what’s going on or what problems to tackle.  Sadly the game doesn’t have the best complaint system unless you look at buildings.  Anything wrong and there’s a little complaint on top of a house.  There’s a twitter style feed on the top of the screen that tells you random things going on in your little corner of the world, but it doesn’t give a deep understanding of what’s going on.  Imagine if a mayor of a town could only find out what’s going on with a twitter feed.  It’s a little silly, the single interactions with the populace doesn’t work.  I'd have preferred an advisor telling me what are the major issues people are talking about.\\n\\nIn addition, the game is VERY slow.  A single day is 10 seconds… at that rate you pass a year in an hour of constant running.  That’s a bit long in my opinion.  But triple speed makes a day only … 5 seconds!  Wait what?  Yeah.. triple speed only doubles the time in my test.  That means a year is 30 minutes.  That’s quite slow still.  I’m sure it’s due to the simulation time and such, but really, quite slow.  The game is focused on weekly cycles instead of monthlies but it’s a very long year. \\n\\nThe one thing I’m not a fan of here is that the game currently promotes its expansions and there’s a lot.  It’s starting to become like the Sims, where there’s tons of content each one in its own expansion.  Luckily the game doesn’t feel like you need expansions as the main game is fantastic on its own and fully featured, but if you have to have it all.  In fact, there’s good quality of life additions to the game along with the expansions.  However, it feels that expansions are a bit of a mixed blessing.  You can remove DLC from Steam by uninstalling the DLC itself but in game, if they are installed they are always on.  Want to switch from a Snowfall game to a one without?  You need to uninstall the DLC. \\n\\nYet the player can avoid all the DLC and the game is still fantastic, it’s a fully featured game with a lot of depth.  The ability to grow your city and then tackle new problems is rather refreshing as you can focus your talents on the smaller tasks even on a second playthrough.  Designing your city is easier when you’re able to focus on it at first.  You can fly through the ranks quickly especially once you know what you’re doing.\\n\\nThere’s a  very solid UI as well once you learn it, and interesting challenges for the player to tackle.  There’s not much here I dislike.  Even the annoyances are minor in comparison.  I plop down a few zones and I start remembering why I love this game.  It’s not just that it reminds me of a great game.  It’s a great game on its own.  While I didn’t like Cities in Motion much, this is exactly the game I was hoping they would make, and now that it’s here.  It is kind of fantastic. \\n\\nSo ....\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this review or want to see my opinion on other games you can find my curator page at this link.  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/ Give me a follow\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .\\n\\nThe size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.\\n\\nDespite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. \\n\\nI also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. \\n\\nThis is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"To be honest, I really like the game. It has some rough edges and some odd design decisions on occasion, but overall it is a good quality game that I have enjoyed playing. Yet.. I'm appalled by the data collection that this game does, especially since it is a single player game. What is being collected and how it is used is all in the privacy policy for Paradox, but it is required to agree to the terms of the agreements to play the game now. Effectively, this holds the game hostage so that Paradox can use your data about you, your hardware, and the other software on your computer for its own benefit just so you can play the game you purchased. This makes me question purchasing and playing other products owned or published by Paradox now. Through this change, Paradox has effectively lost me as a customer because of their boneheaded data collection policies.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I was very conflicted with this game up until recently. The main issue I have is this: When your city gets big enough the game is a piece of cake. There is depth in the city painter part of the game, but close to none in the management side of things. For a long time I'd play the game, after several hours my city would become extremely profitable and then I'd play for a few more hours before uninstalling and waiting for a new DLC that would add management depth. That DLC never came. The next DLC won't bring it. Unfortunately I doubt it ever will.  What made me go from that level of disappointment to really liking the game? Seeing in a new light. This game is an amazing city builder. Amazing painter of cities. If you want to create a city that looks and feels like you want it to you have that ability. Building what seems like a giant county of varied and unique zones with different looking towns and purposes is the best I've ever seen. Playing this game with the intention of making my own New York or London is what it's near perfect as. The DLC just gives more tools to diversify the environment. So if picture a city in your head you can make it in this game. The opportunities are there\\n If you want to struggle to build and maintain it with tons of management tools this isn't for you. Overall it's a 9/10 for me\",\n",

After the learning curve the pervasive issues become tiring though.\\n\\nThere are fundamental mechanisms within this game that have been broken from launch but don't get addressed. Most of them have to do with traffic. This game relies heavily on road placement and traffic management for your success so it's more than frustrating when the AI is too dumb.\\n\\nWhen a building is being serviced by something like a firetruck or an ambulance it will block the lane on the road. In the real world traffic would drive into the oncoming lane to get around the obstruction. In this game everyone waits until the one lane moves again. So a firetruck heading to a fire will just sit idling in traffic waiting for an ambulance do its thing, because it's not programmed to drive around when possible. \\n\\nHave the devs ever seen how firetrucks actually drive???\\n\\nDo you think a firetruck would put out a fire and move onto the burning building next door? Not in this game. They will be heading back to the hall for some well-deserved coffee while the neighbours wait for their colleagues to arrive to rescue the family dog.\\n\\nAt least government waste is simulated accurately.\\n\\nCars driving on the highway or multiple-lane city streets will all use a single lane instead of changing lanes to utilize all of the road. Such a thing never happens in reality. The result is a huge traffic jam whether the road is one or six lanes.\\n\\nThese glaring problems are years old and nothing gets fixed.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Absoultely wonderful game!  I have played over 850 hours.  This is what SimCity 5 should have been.  This game was obviously made by people who love city building and played previous city simulatons.  Everything works right.  Slow initial city loading time but from there all is smooth.   Many ways to play.  Lay out a design for a big city or small town are the fine as they are, or soon grown and eventually join.   Lots to learn to be more efficient.  Can be played casual or challenging. As with real cities traffic congestion and polution soon become a growing problem.  Lots of in game items that are solutions...  But it is very satifying to figure out your own unique designs and solutions.   A big active community of support is another good feature of this game.   I had all my friends by this game they all liked it or loved it as I do.   I highly recommend it.',\n",

The game generally works fine and everything is working as expected, and you can fix many flaws, make the game harder and add content through mods and the workshop.\\n\\nIn the vanilla game (without mods) there's a bug that happens with water once your city becomes really big. If you're aiming at making a very big city you'll probably fall in this bug unless you install a mod that addresses it. Citizens will become sick without any apparent reason. Building more drain pipes and water towers won't fix it. Even switching entirely from pumping water from a water source to using water towers won't fix that, so you're basically screwed and forced to abandon your city.\\n\\nI'm surprised developers haven't looked into that and that issue is still a thing, but as I said, as long as you install the proper mod the issue won't happen.\\n\\n8/10.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I had an ice factory catch on fire. 69/10.\\n\\nNo, but seriously. I have played a lot of city sims in my day (Simcity, Tropico, CitiesXL, etc) and I can say this is the best I have played. While the game may be hard to wrap your head around at first (the game does a poor job introducing you, and there doesn\\'t seem to be any real tutorial) once you start learning how to create your districts, city blocks, highway systems, services, mass transit, etc. the game really starts to take off in sheer size and scope. The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It\\'s a far cry from the tiny \\'districts\\' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder \"why can\\'t I place this here\" or \"why isn\\'t this working?\". The amount of in-game content for your city is also quite robust, and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more.\\n\\nThis is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own.\\n9/10',\n",

With mods, however, this game becomes a model train set with no limitations. See r/CitiesSkylines on reddit and you will see the power of mods.',\n",

       "  'review': 'At 576 hours, I would love to be able to recommend this game to friends however I would not recommend this game to anyone especially any o my friends.\\n\\nThe base game at this moment costs $29.99 and they also have a Deluxe edition for $39.99\\n\\nIf you wanted all of the DLC excluding the music, at a normal non-sale price this is $205.00\\n\\nAnd some of these DLC add features such as Snow for $12.99 or Mass Transit for the same price. For a game that\\'s supposed to be focused on transit itself, this game is severely lacking in that regards if you were to just buy the base game. Snow is the mod you have to buy just to get access to a light-rail type system of inner city transit. Mass Transit is required basically to access anything above a horribly designed subway interface and the bus system.\\n\\nAlong with this, you also need mods to play the game. I wish I could say they weren\\'t necessary but they 100% are necessary just to make the game play correctly. One mod that was necessary was the Realistic population mod. In the stock game, a skyscraper would only have 8-9 residents total. With the population mod, this is set somewhere in the range of 100-120 residents.I just don\\'t understand the logic of the stock game.\\n\\nRecently, Paradox released a new launcher and new EULA which seeing the response of the community vs Paradox just made me completely lose interest in this game. Paradox is truly showing their colors on how they feel by stating that \"you don\\'t actually own this game and we can change your ability to access the game at any time\". For that, and the other reasons I have listed I cannot continue to support this game.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a good city building game then I would honestly suggest picking up Sim City 4 and just using the NAM mod on that until someone actually comes out with decent city building game.',\n",

At first I thought it seemed a bit confusing compared to SimCity but after a while it became easy to play and I started enjoying it. I am impressed with the traffic simulation. It is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads. Of course SimCity has advantages in other ways but I am pleasantly surprised by Cities: Skylines and I can definitely recommend it!\\n\\nP.S. You end up being addicted to the game :D',\n",

       "  'review': \"Cities: Skylines is the city builder I've been waiting for since 2004. It is intuitive, has actual working citizen travel, flowing water, (mostly) realistic travel... and looks beautiful.\\nIt is also designed to be mod friendly and mods are already expanding the game within the first weeks of release.\\n\\nAnd no forced online or tiny city sizes. Even without mods, you can built a huge metropolis in this game.\\n\\nMusic is forgettable. Nothing like the excellent SimCity series :/\\n\\nAnd it is extremely addictive. This game will cause you to be tired at work because you stayed up until 3am on a working day...\\n\\nTDLR: Best City Builder in over a decade. Buy it today.\\n\\nMinor edit in 2020 since the game has been getting continual support. Previously I had complaints about the traffic system, but this has long since been resolved.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"When starting off Cities Skylines I thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it. The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqfpr9MV00k&feature=youtu.be\\n\\n\\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\\n\\n+ Runs really well and is decently optimized, even with a bigger city depending on your rig the game would still run really smooth (Window 7 64 bit from my end)\\n\\n+ The interface is straight from sim city so those with experience knows how to jump into the game with ease. Easy enough for new players to  understand and complex enough even for the hard edge veterans.\\n\\n+ The cities goes looks fantastic with modded material and district creation, the area changes on its look depending on what type of police you set in place. \\n\\n+ The traffic system, water, and power system all works in this game right from the start in the game creating less stress to the player( WOW!)\\n\\n+ The district systems lets you color out zones and implement polices for the game giving you the option to create bans on certain things such as pets or smoking ban and creating unique distrits throughout your city\\n\\n+ Easy to use tax system and system to use for \\n\\n+ Bigger map sizes for building. I had a Simcity complex where I would build in the small square a while taking up as much room as I can and being efficient as possible. It was easy enough to maintain a city and then expanding. Once expanding the city gets bigger and bigger and looks amazing.\\n\\n+Mod support on day one players are able to download others maps, building objects etc through steam workshop. The editor is also very easy to use and import/export material in to work with.\\n\\n\\n[h1] Cons (Or things that Cities Skyline needs to add)[/h1]\\n- The game lacks depth and challenge for end game content. I find the game is easy and even on hard mode( which I play on) it was pretty easy if one knows how to balance out efficiency and building his city.  In the end you will make a ton of money and just basically start plopping amazingly huge cities without a clear goal. There isn't any concept of material needs for the game to improve the lives of the people of the city (Which sim city had) to give it that extra depth.\\n\\n- The snap for placing road sometimes can be a bit wonky and needs a bit more work. There isn't a city preplanning tool to help you preplan and no rewind button. Once ya place it you delete it and replace it etc.\\n\\n- No dynamic day/night cycle and disasters. These two are important function because seeing your city glow in the night is simply amazing and having disasters give you a sort of thrill in when it does occur. Without it the game doesn't offer much of a challenge unless you mess up your electrical/water or one of the needs of necessity in which case you create a disaster from it. \\n\\n- The npcs are not that entertaining to watch since they do not adhere to a day and night cycle rule. Therefore they aren't as robust and dynamic if one actually follows them for a for a few.\\n\\n- No multiplay ( Don't know if this will ever come true in the future)\\n\\n- Blurry graphic at times at highest settings, turn down shift helps a bit and a bit of film grain is added to the game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Once upon a time there was a game called SimCity . Back in the 90s it was one of the most innovated games of all times that put the foundation for a whole genre. Unfortunately a bad witch named Electronic arts killed it in a very brutal way, the last (2013) version was a disgrace. Thank god paradox interactive manage to resurrect it in the form of city skylines. City skylines is the best city builder this time, actually it is what a modern successor of  SimCity should be. \\n\\nGreat graphics and game mechanics , very relaxing music and highly addictive gameplay. Moreover the available mods can transform the game to whatever you want . I can understand the negative reviews concerning the amount of DLCs but I am afraid that this is the price we must pay for the continuous development of the game all this years. I definably recommend it.\\n',\n",

Create a bus route and don't enough stops ? Hahaha well you will have a ton of people waiting outside because not enough stops and buses to meet the demand.\\n+Awesome path editor with many different road types and bridges and scenery\\n+ Steam Workshop\\n+Easy UI\\n+ Progressing with milestones feels rewarding\\n+ Wind Turbines turn against wind, I thought this was really cool.\\n\\nNow there is a ton more +'s but my hand hurts from carpool tunnel from playing the game like 15 hours straight so\\n\\nHeres the -'s\\n\\n-Pathing on cars sometimes sucks bad\\n-Not really many events other than random fires which don't spread =( ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )\\n-Road pathing tool can be pretty annoying when trying to upgrade skinny streets to wide streets\\n-No Auto Save Feature (Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively)\\n-No Cycle of day and night ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )\\n-Sometimes the game moves at such a fast pace that's not desirable, usually people like to speed it -up but if you have a decent city, the demand for structures will never stop or slow down! ( Can pause but a slow down option ? )\\n-Wish there was weather other than the wind is moving this way or that way\\n\\n\\nThings I would like in the game\\n\\n*Riots ( Maybe a military base with units ? or swat team that could stop riots ?)\\n*More Events\\n*Spreading Fire ( Natively ) \\n*( I am not sure if it exists outside of a mod ) But snow?\\n*More things for people to do other than parks and plazas ( Baseball Park, Football Stadium, etc... I *know the workshop will have tons of this stuff, but it would be nice to have the professional touch on more buildings with animations! )  Btw the soccer park in the work shop is pretty cool!\\n*Seasons that change on time of year\\n*Night Mode with lighted sky scrapers and other models\\n\\nI highly recommend this game, although it's more serious sim then that which you can have fun destroying your creations ( at the time being at least ). $30 dollars is a great steal, if you are affraid of DLC, the workshop should ease that a but with over 20,000 items and growing!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities: Skylines is the unofficial SimCity sequel we deserve! From the very beginning, the game feels much closer to SimCity 4 than the most recent iteration of SimCity. The game embraces Steam Workshop, and the amount of custom content already is outstanding. I have enjoyed every second thus far with the game and I wanted to share my thoughts on it for those of you on the fence.\\n\\nPROS\\n-Steam Workshop Integration\\n-Massive Cities\\n-Enjoyable Challenge\\n-Cities Feel Alive\\n-Hours and Hours of Content\\n-Great Price for Launch\\n-Allows for Cities of All Shapes and Sizes\\n\\nCONS\\n-Traffic Needs Some Balancing\\n-Lots of Repeated Buildings (Custom Content Helps)\\n-Trash and Death Can Get Out of Hand Due to Traffic\\n\\nAll in all, I recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who considers themselves fans of the simulation genre. The game is addictive and provides hours of fun. I am 15 hours in and I only have 50,000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow. The $30 is fair, but there is no excuse not to pick this game up at a sale price!\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"To me, this game has become the new modern standard citybuilding game. It's a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to it's roots. Clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of Maxis and EA with SimCity; everywhere it failed to deliver, this game has got it. With a focus on things like Steam Workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasn't been made to become a DLC machine. \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jnWhIaxgpM\\n\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n> Wide audience appeal. It feels that it can be as casual or as serious as you want it to be. Not at all daunting for a first timer to use, and even includes things like hard mode for the more seasoned city builder.\\n \\n> The game feels very well optimised and runs very nicely. Both my laptop and desktop PC play this game very well.\\n\\n> Easy to use world and assets editors for deeper customisation. Asset creations such as parks, buildings, intersections, props and even trees. All uploadable and retrievable through Steam Workshop.\\n\\n> It has a very detailed simulation of city life. Features things like dynamic water that makes dams usable, or gives you the ability to poison the city water supply with poorly placed pumping stations and drain pipes. You can follow people, cars, buses etc and you can see these people are living out daily lives. The city does feel alive.\\n\\n> Huge expandable worlds to build in. No more cities the size of a village like on SimCity. You can actually build massive sized cities!\\n\\n> You also have freely controllable taxes, funding and policies not only at a city level but also at a district level that can change the feel and dynamic of the cities and the people that live in them. You have a twitter-esque system that gives reports on how people are feeling based on tweets they make about the city.\\n\\n> There's lots to do with the roads. Many different shapes and sizes, one-way systems, highways, dirt roads, pavements etc, and they can all be raised, curved or done freeform.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n> No day or night cycle! It seems so many situations on the roadways (rush hours etc) can't be experienced, which makes the traffic feel a bit basic a lot of the time.\\n\\n> Whilst there is a lot to do with the roads, it's not always as accurate as I would like. It makes building more complex road systems a bit of a pain, and won't let you connect up roads and paths in a way you may want. I hope it gets an update soon to let us customise our roads even better.\\n\\n> I notice a lot of the same buildings appearing next to each other, like having a street with just the same burger bar a few times on it. More building variation and randomisation would be nice, but I imagine this could be solved with user-created content.\\n\\n> Some of the figures feel a bit off. The population figures always feel a bit low compared to what you may expect from the current state of your city.\\n\\nOverall it's a lovely feeling game and comparatively to other city builders to come out in recent years, this is definitely the pick of the bunch. It's well priced on launch compared to competitors, especially SimCity.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Concerning the DLC Practices of Paradox Interactive & Paradox Developement Studio\\n\\nThe dlc practices of pdx seem offensive at first, until you learn they only release a major game once evry 5 or 6 years and then contiually update them for longer than that.  They need the dlc influx to continue with their constant dedication to their projects.  Ckii is more than five years old, and next month it is getting an expansion that has been stated to not be the last.  The idea of \\'games as a service\\' is actually properly done by the company and its fans and creators are open with each other and share their ideas.  They are very human.  The downside is that if you didn\\'t get on the train as it was leaving the station it is very intimidating to see the long dlc lists.  Most are cosmetic.  It is easier to think of pdx games as a subscription in which every 4-5 months you pay a 5-20 USD subscription fee to support continued developement of the games.  The dlc is optional and far better than the atroicious dlc policies of ea, activision, and ubisoft: \"Here buy this uber deluxe expansion pass edition that costs 150 USD.\" Those game sare abandoned ghost towns within a year.  However,  with pdx games you know they will be around a while constantly increase player count.  And for the price of a cheesesteak, an Arnold Palmer,  and fries you can have an addtion to your game you will play for a decade.  Therefore it is unfair to equate this to dlc packs in AAA games like fallout, mass effect, and assissins creed.  You can either have a greedy company who puts out a disposable game like AC and asks foir over 100USD for dlc you care about for 2 months, or buy a map pack for CoD which you\\'ll only find enough friends to play with for a year or so, or you can buy into a pdx title which is far more deep, has an amazing community, and will stick around for almost a decade.  If you want the later, you have to be willing to financially support the studio who desires to continue perfecting your game.  In a throw away gaming culture, I for one find pdx\\'s practices a breath of fresh air.',\n",

       "  'review': \"For anyone looking for countless hours of fun, this is your game. Cities: Skylines provides countless hours of fun, but challenging, hours of game play. In cities: Skylines, you get to basically manage your own city. To sum it up, Cities: Skylines is the best city manager simulation I know. Here are some pros and cons of the game.\\nPROS:\\n-Beautiful Graphics\\n-Good concept\\n-Has amazing workshop Mods\\n-Thrill of being able to tax other people (my favorite!)\\n-Easy to learn about\\n-Provides a challenge (in some ways) \\n-Great for players looking for something to do\\n-The new Natural Disasters are amazing!\\n-The new DLC Natural disasters lets you bust criminals from a helicopter\\nThese are just some of the pros this game provides\\n\\nCONS\\nEvery game has a downside to it. Here are a few you might want to think about before buying\\n-Some of the in-game challenges such as death care and traffic can be hard to solve, but can be resolved with experience and (LOTS) of patience\\n-Id say a good computer is needed to play this game without lag. This game is playable with lag, but will slightly impact your enjoyment of the game.\\n\\nOverall, Cities: Skylines is a great game. I've been playing this for a while now, and I believe I will continue to do. I look forward to the next update and recommend for players to buy this game.\",\n",

Simcity was THE game growing up and now Skylines has brought that back in tenfold. Skylines is missing three things that I would love to see. \\n\\nDisasters: No not zombies or monster attacks... Disasters..a weather dynamic system such as rain, snow, tornadoes, hurricanes, monsoons, mudslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions. Also economic and human disasters would be awesome..i.e WWIII breaks out and the fights come to your city due to its important economic means and its military base\\n\\nElections and Council: Have a mode or option where you to put your record and city building skills on table and run against an opponent who may take your mayor position away. Also allow the option of adding a city council that can help or hamper your city planning by blocking or giving out city resources and land.\\n\\n\\nMajor Company HQ's, Sporting Events/teams and world events: Let us negotiate deals with major companies to build hq's in the city which may require tearing down a popular city spot. Let us bid for the olympics  then have to build the buildings should we win the bid! Or bid for major sports teams from all the major leagues of the world then negotiating new stadiums for said team. World events such as a Worlds Fair, or Papal Visit, or other major world events. \\n\\n\\nThat's my three wishes. Maybe a developer will see at least one ;)\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities: Skylines feels like a proper successor to the classic SimCity games.  If you grew up on classics like SimCity, SimCity 2000, and SimCity 4, you\\'ll probably feel at home here.\\n\\n  For those not familiar, in this genre you build a city by zoning out commecial, residential, and industrial areas as well as the necessary infrastructure (roads, water, power) and an increasing number of other public goods such as police protection, fire protection, education, etc.  You set tax rates which impact the economy, and try to stay in the black and allow your city to continue to grow.  It\\'s an addictive experience of constant expansion, with another thing you want to build or problem you want to fix always on the horizon and keeping the real-time game version of \"one more turn\" on your lips.\\n\\n  As with most of these games, one of the things you\\'ll spend the most time on besides simply laying out more roads and then laying down zones and support buildings is traffic management, and at this Skylines shines.  The road construction system offers you a wide variety of to configure your roads with different sizes, one-way-vs-two-way, overpasses, etc, and the traffic flow responds to what you build in sensible and complicated ways.  It\\'s a compelling component of the game that can consume hours of your life.  Additional options such as foot paths, bus routes, trains, and subways can also lighten the car traffic in your city.\\n\\n  Skylines also features an intersting \"neighborhood\" system where you can subdivide your city into different sections and set different city ordinances or economic focuses for each one.  While I don\\'t feel that the mechanics of this have as much impact as I might like, just being able to district your city into distinct neighborhoods with their own names helps bring your city into focus and give it more character and specificity.\\n(the Nightlife expansion also adds to this system, but most of my playtime was done before that came out so I\\'m not reviewing the expansion content, here)\\n\\n  Things I don\\'t lke about the game?\\n\\n  Primarily, it feels too easy.  Even from the start I virtually never drifted into the red, although I would occasionally stall out and need to make some tweaks to keep growing.  This seems like it\\'d be something that is mod-able, but better difficulty options for veterans of the genre who want a challenge would be nice.\\n\\n  Additionally, as your city develops it seems that older industrial neighborhoods will occassionally suffer mass unemployment for no apparent reason.  The economic specializations you can assign to neighborhoods, in particular, suffer from this doubly and feel like a very short road to a dead end.\\n\\n  The industrial collapse itself is a good thing- an interesting challenge to tackle in a game that generally lets you just keep expanding with ease- but the feedback as to why it happens is poor.  For example, faced with the situation I\\'d frequently click on the buildings and see that they had no workers.  Thinking that I\\'d simply educated my populace out of wanting those jobs, I\\'d try building a school-free slum neighborhood nearby to see if that brought the businesses back, but the businesses remained without workers for no apparent reason.\\n\\n  Also, the in-game twitter-alike is inane and way too chatty, but this is a minor quibble.\\n\\n  Other than these complaints, I could list a score of minor to moderate UI annoyances- the inevitable consequence of playing a bunch of a game- but the only one that really sits heavily in my mind is the dread I\\'d feel whenever I made significant changes to my subway system.  It\\'s not always clear what happens to existing routes when you make changes and getting a big-picture view of what all of your current routes look like in aggregate can be difficult; a cleaner and color-coded subway route map view would be nice.\\n\\n  All in all, I\\'d heartily recommend Cities: Skylines as an enjoyable sandbox that can easily consume dozens of hours of your life.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Cities: Skylines is a great city sim game; possibly one of the best out there. It's intuitive, pretty, and addictive to play. There's a lot of little milestones and unlocks that constantly nudge you gently forward and give you just one more thing to fix, one more thing to tweak, one more thing to add. Suddenly your city is booming and you need to place more residential. Now there's more traffic and you need to rework your roads. Once those are handled you notice some new buildings and services have unlocked, and you begin planning around where they should go. It's a great system, and the game never feels hectic or rushed. You can always do things at your own pace, which really benefits a city-building game in my mind.\\n\\nAll that said, I can't recommend this game unless it's heavily on sale. Not because it's a bad game. It's not - it's a great game. But Paradox's DLC practices are nausea-inducing. The base game has enough to get by and have fun, but there's a ton of ease-of-living and sometimes downright necessary functions locked behind completely useless DLC. They did it with Crusader Kings, they did it with Europa Universalis, and now they're doing it here, so I doubt they plan to stop any time soon. The Transit DLC adds a ton of public transport functionality...for $13. You can set your city up to cater to the night life, with night clubs and 24/7 stores...for $15. There can be natural disasters and buildings to mitigate their damage, adding a fun bit of chaos to otherwise totally safe gameplay...for $15. And now, with the Green Cities DLC, they've added a ton of new and useful content, but locked it all behind a paywall. Most of this is stuff that should've been in the base game, or free updates. Why does a customer need to pay to unlock winter or the ability to recycle? It boggles the mind.\\n\\nIt's a great game marred by awful DLC practices. If you want to buy it, buy it on sale and do some research on the available DLC beforehand so you can decide which bits of game functionality you are willing to pay for in order to fully enjoy the game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I had actually started to believe that we were never going to see another great city simulator and then Paradox sprung this on us. Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.\\n\\nProbably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.\\n\\nBut that's the only [i]real[/i] problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"One of the best city scenario games that is out there.\\n\\nI will split this review into 4 different sections. Each sections will be covering different topics. \\n\\nCampaigns/Scenarios\\n\\nBecause this game is focusing on building your own metropolis, there's is no particular campaing. However there are several scenarios, each one is focusing on something different. Plus if you will buy DLCS to this game (for example; Natural Disasters DLC) you may get more scenarios with unique goals and maps. I found this cool because if you’re just bored of creating another city, you can just hop in one of those scenarios and start digging your own adventure. Some scenarios have easy/straightforward goals whereas other’s are hard and requier many side steps in order to proceed or complete the challenge/scenario. The best thing about this I would say is the fact that if you’re starting a specific scenario, you may already have a city to start with and problems that the specific city is facing. For example, in one of the natural disasters DLC scenario, you have a small city which is under a dam and it already has some several problems. This is what I like about it. The fact that you don’t need to start over and over. You can just join into a scenario and you already have a city. \\n\\nGraphics/Design\\n\\nThe game itself has good graphisc. Therefore I am sure that you don’t need a super expensive PC. However there’s one thing that you cannot take for granted. Bugs were the major problem for me. There’s not that many bugs but some can be really annoying or even gamebreaking. I am not really professional when it comes to bugs, but I just want to warn you that you should be ready for some minor bugs or at some point game breaking ones. The design is very neat and professional. The developers made a really good job with lights and objects. The best feeling for me was always starring at my city during the night.  But as I said I am not really into this, anways I just wanted to say that.\\n\\nCommunity\\n\\nThis is the thing that is keeping this game alive. If you will visit workshop of Cities Skylines, you will find everything. You can add car models, real-life buildings, roads, planes and etc. There’s so many things that you can save up and they will completely redefine your city. Sometimes workshop items are even better than some overpriced dlcs. (I will get to that later) When I first visited the workshop, I was there for aproximetly 2 hours. There is a large amount of artworks and discussions. So whenever you face a game-breaking bug, you can just go to the discussion. There are also videos, some are for focusing on some tips whereas others are focusing on gameplay or some other things (mods for example). \\n\\nDLCs\\n\\nThis is probably the biggest problem with Cities Skyline. This game has a lot of DLCs. Many of them are very cool, such as the Natural Disaster DLC or the After Dark DLC. But then there are DLCs which add only few new buildings and cost around 15 euros. For example, the concert DLC adds few new buildings but costs around 15 euros. (or less, correct me on that if I am wrong.) If you want some DLCs I recommend waiting for sale. \\n\\nSUMMARY\\nThis game is very interesting game which is for people who like building or designing cities. Its massive community is driving the game towards the future. The DLCs are good but some are seriously overpriced. There’s few game-breaking bugs but at the end of the day. I give this game 9/10.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"A nice city builder game.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1702890657\\nFirst of all, I was very wondered with such high reviews. I doubted it is possible to bring something new to modern city builder gameplay. I liked the game, but I was right, the game doesn't introduce new & amazing features.\\n\\nYou start with a square of clear land. Most of the time you don't place buildings, you choose land and your type ( living zone, stores or production area). Buildings are built automatically. I liked it. Most of the time you just add new roads and choose type of areas. It is the main loop. You will do it 60% of game time. After reaching certain amount of population, you get access to new buildings : schools, police, fire station, garbage storage, cemeteries and etc. You need to build new special building with each significant grows of population.\\n\\nAfter that you get road problems. There is getting so much vehicles, so you need to remake roads, add buses and metro and etc. \\nI suppose there is more of stuff, but you need to buy DLC.\\n\\nIn overall, I liked playing the game, I wasn't extremely happy, it was just a good game.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1702890714\\nPros\\n- Main gaming loop is very simple to understand and addictive to play\\n- It is interesting to see how vehicles move and improve road situation\\n- Zoom options. You can see how people walk\\n- A lot of stuff if count DLCs. You can play this game for hundred of hours\\n\\nCons\\n- No goal to achieve. No story, scenario and objectives. Just make city as much bigger as you can\\n- You need to buy tens of DLC to unlock extra features\\n- Some mechanics was completely unclear. Metro line planning, for example.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1702890733\\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\\nA nice City Builder game. Don't expect something epic, it is just a good game in the genre. Take it you like city builders.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'TL;DR\\nThis was once a good game until everything was put into DLCs.\\nYou now have to spend literally 200 USD (160€) to have \"a game\".\\n\\nVery nice city simulation. I especially like the vehicle traffic... jk\\n\\nBUT! \\n1. The DLC policy is cancerous in a way that Paradox is taking to new heights (CK2, Stellaris, HOI...).\\nThe DLC scheme is so appalling that I simply can\\'t in any serious mind recommend this product. It just silly to expect your customers to pay for every single basic feature and such huge prices. Maybe if these DLCs were priced closer to their actual worth and desirability I might recommend but right now there is no way I would support this behavior.\\n2. The game quickly becomes a traffic manager as soon as any major population size is met, and it\\'s really tedious. The AI for traffic is pretty bad and it really relies on mods to try and fix it. A game should be accentuated by mods, not rely on it to fix it.\\n3. It\\'s all too utopian, which I know is a bit of weird criticism. The original SimCity series felt far grungier, with gritty, melancholy music, and the potential for whole swathes of dismal city blocks that looked like something out of the suburbs of Mega-City One. Given Simcity 2000 was release in the early 90\\'s, there\\'s a definite vibe of the 80\\'s depression era. City games *should* have slumps, depressions, crime, social issues, challenges in terms of society and culture. Not once, no matter how big my city get in CS, did it feel like my city was anything more than a larger version of Pleasantville full of happily medicated cims.\\n\\nAlthough, the ~200 bucks price tag for full game is pretty funny since many consider 70 excessive. Just hold my beer, right?',\n",

A [b]proper city building[/b] game. In essence, even the business model behind this game achieves this. A game with rapid DLC production means a game with CONSTANT content and support, subsequently creating a huge modding community. These modifications change the game in incredibly meaningful ways. From intricate traffic management (TM:PE), to ULT and lighting adaptations. This allows the player to transport themselves into the most realistic, beautiful looking places you could imagine. From just a small, pitstop gas station in the desert to large transport networks and interchanges, you can make anything you might see in real life traveling in your car. \\n[hr][/hr]\\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in painting a scene you might see in real life.

       "  'review': 'This game saved my life.\\n\\nI am 38.\\n\\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\\n\\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\\n\\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\\n\\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn\\'t beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\\n\\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\\n\\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don\\'t fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\\n\\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\\n\\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn\\'t be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\\n\\nThank you',\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh boy, this fucking game.\\n\\nCities: Skylines is Sim City. No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don\\'t even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.\\n\\nI don\\'t have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I\\'m certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they\\'re not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to \"paint\" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it\\'s difficult to describe. Watching little buildings pop up, filling with residents populating the area is incredible to behold. You can even name every single object in the game, whether it be a building, a citizen, or even some random cougar roaming in the countryside. I took it upon myself to name every High School I built after any American presidents i can think of.\\n\\nI never thought this would happen, but as of 3/16/15 Cities: Skylines is my GOTY of 2015. It\\'s been quite some time when a video game can suck away my time as well as this one. There\\'s always more land to develop, more resources to export, more ways to attempt to fix your horribly congested traffic fuckups. While the game doesn\\'t do a perfect simulation, as the AI drivers refuse to take up multiple lanes in some instances, the amount of detail is incredible. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and all the cars are traveling with a purpose. It is important to make sure all the needs of your city are met, whether it be water, waste, dead people, sick people, schooling, fires, it really becomes overwhelming really quick. In fact, most of your first attempts at this game will create perpetual hellholes of civilization, tall gloomy buildings stuffed with stinking dead bodies and backed up sewage. However, in my opinion this does only galvanizes you to make your city better, by redirecting traffic and building public transports to lessen the load on commuter roads. Who knew city planning could be so fun?\\n\\nCities: Skylines isn\\'t perfect, as evidenced by the traffic stingy AI and sometimes confusing circumstances where pressing criteria around the city aren\\'t clear. There aren\\'t any disasters that can hurt your city (other than accidental flooding from a Hydroelectric Dam). However, as seen by the ridiculous amount of mods that have hit the steam workshop a mere few days after release, this may be remedied. You can even create your own landscape using the map editors, and I dread to see what messing around with that will do my free time in the future.\\n\\nIf you have any interest in city simulations at all, you need to get this game now. Probably the best one to come out in a long, long time.',\n",

       "  'review': \"If you're reading this, I'm glad you take the time to read reviews before you buy a game. But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).\\n\\nSo stop reading this review and buy the game.\\n\\nFor those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.\\n\\n[list]\\n[*]1.) One-way-roads and roundabouts\\n[*]2.) Water physics: water pumps, sewage drains, treatment plants, and dams influence water levels\\n[*]3.) Parked cars. Doesn't seem like this should be a new feature in city-builders, but it is. Cars park on the side of the road and in parking spots.\\n[*]4.) Districts and policies: paint districts on certain parts of your city to keep track of things better and issue local policies.\\n[*]5.) Mods galore. The workshop is filled with various mods and the game has an asset and map editor built in.\\n[/list]\\n\\nHopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.\\n\\nUPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:\\nFor the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free).\",\n",

This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.\\n\\nHighs:\\n\\n* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.\\n\\n* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.\\n\\n* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.\\n\\n* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.\\n\\nLows:\\n\\n* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. \\n\\n* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it\\'s almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.\\n\\n* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don\\'t often line up well. My metro station might say \"100 per week\" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.\\n\\nVerdict:\\n\\nIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Cities: Skylines is a city builder game of your dreams. You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life. \\n\\nSo the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.\\n\\nThe game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while. \\n\\n[b]7.5 /10[/b]\",\n",

You have four demands that keep you ever expanding your city and those are: residential zone demand, industrial zone demand, business zone demand, and services demand (being schools, hospitals, police, electricity, water, etc.)\\n\\nPros:\\n- The game does a good job at encouraging expansion. You never stagnant because there is always something to build. You can take out loans so if you don't have money saved but demands for zones or services you don't have to wait.\\n\\n-Roads Roads Roads Roads Roads. Everything revolves around Roads. Everything must border a road to be built. You also have traffic.

If you are like me when you are driving in a city and curse at the city planner for nonsensical/impractical design you will be humbled by this game when you realize these little simulated folks are cursing your name just as vehemently.\\n\\n-You have population milestones that expand your technologies and give you a sizable monetary bonus.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Traffic AI can be a huge problem if not dealt with early on.\\n-Some buildings require a certain population level in order to unlock/build. Like a forestry industrial zone. Why do I need a certain population to cut down trees? Thankfully you can turn this feature off and be able to build everything right from the beginning so even that is hardly a negative.\\n\\nConclusion: Cities Skylines is best at doing what is does, plus you get the expansion packs which enhance the longevity of the game. it's a game worth playing for hours and hours nonstop  =  9 / 10.\",\n",

It\\'s great with or without mods, and with or without DLC that the devs are still pumping out. So should you be clicking on \"add to cart\" immediately? That depends. While the base game stands on its own well, most of the content DLC is fantastic....and expensive. My advise is...\\n 1.) WAIT FOR A STEAM SALE!!. The base game, along with all but the most recent DLC, is often drastically reduced during steam sales due to its age.\\n 2.)Unless you really really like it or have an exorbitant amount of disposable income, don\\'t bother with the radio station or aesthetic DLCs because even with sale prices, the feature DLC packs will be costing plenty.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Yes, I'm giving it a thumbs down after over 3500 hours played. Want to know why?\\n\\nBecause a game that basically lives or dies on its workshop content should not hit you in a face with a literal spreadsheet every few weeks so you can spend an hour making it work again, and in the process also figure out which of your favorite mods it made obsolete by breaking the backwards compatibility again.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\nTo me, over a third of the game's value comes from the workshop - half of it is just extra content, but the other half is quality of life fixes and utilities, many of which are critical to me to properly enjoy the game. And they know it as well - they integrated ideas from mods into the game, they hired modders to be their employees, the mod spotlight is basically using mods as their marketing material. For a project that so desperately relies on the unpaid work of their loving community, they sure have a nasty habit of exploiting that love.\\n\\nA long time age they started aggresively squeezing the cash out of us with tons of small, simple, and expensive DLCs. Then, a while back, they started using bigger DLCs to regularily break the compatibility of workshop content, effectively discouraging long-term modding projects. And since the remaining modders didn't want to maintain multiple versions of their mods depending on which DLCs you have installed, they just started assuming you have them all, and made their mods require them. Which means that the game effectively started holding the mods hostage until you buy the DLC, indirectly monetizing free content.\\n\\nAnd then, they announced the sequel.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm excited for the sequel. I hope they will improve the engine so it can get bigger, better, and will allow for even more creative mods. Let them do all the things that this game could not. Honestly, they can release just the engine and the mod support and it would still be a big hit.\\n\\nBut with a sequel on its way, what's the point of buying this game at this stage? So it can turn into Sims and make you buy all the DLCs a second time for the CS2? So you can get your hopes up and let them disappoint you if it won't work out?\\n\\nDon't buy this game. Just wait for the sequel. And in case it turns out to be a money-grabbing, buggy, rushed, exploitative trainwreck, aiming for nothing more than finding new ways to abuse and monetize the relations with its community, then you can come back here and try this one instead, because it's definitely worth it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\\n\\n10/10: The city builder every other city builder wishes it was. May take over the player's life.\\n\\n[h1]Overview:[/h1]\\n\\nEvery fan of management simulation games will obsess over Cities: Skylines while anyone who would enjoy the challenge of growing a city will have a great time with this game if they can tolerate the repetetive nature that hardcore management simulation fans thrive under.\\n\\nYou grow the city, get more types of services and problems to confront, spend money where needed, and hope that your city can reach the next classification of city type, which grants more money, unlocks new buildings, and that takes you back to square one.  This style of gameplay sometimes gets too repetetive even for my aspie mindset of repetition, but playing this game in short bursts helps me tackle city problems and prevents me from staring at the screen with a blank expression wondering about what to do next while I wonder about how to use what little money I have to expand with while I'm unable to secure any more financing, and see money trickle into my account. (And sometimes watch money run out, depending on which way my luck cuts.)\\n\\n[h1]Graphics and sound:[/h1]\\n\\nIt's obvious from the get-go that this sort of game is graphics intensive, and Cities: Skylines is excellent in the graphics department.  You can easily see things like rain and fog, and see them all either up close, far away, and in full 3D.  But for better or worse, fog is mostly visible from far away, and not from up close.\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918347573\\n\\nThe animation and graphics for pollution is absolutely perfect.  You can not only see the dirty, filthy, stinking haze close up, but you can also see it from far away on buildings that pollute.\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918355011\\n\\nThe only real complaint about graphics, is that industries involved in oil drilling do not build oil derricks on top of their zones.\\n\\nIt actually took me a long time to turn on the sound, and I only did so for the sake of writing a review.  There's nothing awe-inspiring or game-breaking about the game's sounds, but I really disliked the music.  The music was totally out of place, especially for viewing densely populated areas and streets with densely packed traffic.  Your best bet is to just move the main volume slider to 0%, and play music that's to your liking.  Of course, you are free to mute the music volume should you want to hear the game and also listen to your own music.\\n\\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\\n\\nThis game is so awesome, I cannot include everything I like about Cities: Skylines.  (I tried, but my original review would not fit when I tried to copy and paste!) Cities:Skylines takes features from past city management sims, and takes them to a whole new level without feeling outright like a copycat game.  I will say that Cities: Skylines has everything I enjoy about city management games dating back to 1990 and the added ability to rename buildings of every kind, create districts, and rename these districts to anything one wishes.\\n\\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\\n\\nWhile I do love Cities: Skylines, I am bothered by some of the game's flaws, and there's enough flaws, I'm unable to bury the reader in as many paragraphs as I wanted, but I made the mistake of including things that I wish were features, or what I thought should be done differently.  With a city of close to 36,000 people, the only complaints I have room to mention, is that collection of trash and dead bodies is deeply flawed.  It doesn't matter if one has enough landfill or incenerator capacity or space in cemetaries and creamatories, the larger your city becomes, the more likely you can expect to see icons over buildings indicating filthy, stinking garbage and rotting corpses desperately in need of disposal, and the game does nothing to prioritize collection.  \\n\\nA game as complex as Cities: Skylines certainly requires a tutorial, but none is included in game.  Certainly the most seasoned of us need an interactive lesson in the fundamentals. \\n\\nThe act of forbidding tractor trailers from operating on roads via city ordinance seems like a good idea at first, it really bothers me that banning tractor trailers on specific streets (and sometimes stretches of streets) requires making micro-districts dedicated solely to vehicle bans.\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=916928296\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\n\\nCities: Skylines has the city management game genre cornered.  No other city management sim competes. Buy this game.  Buy it at any price. If you can wait for a sale, that's cool, too.  If you like the idea of giving cities a unique feel, you have the ability to rename many of the things you see on see in your city.  And when you do buy this game, you should check out the DLC available for Cities: Skylines.  Some of them are really cool, but others look like awful moneygrabs that you would think only Electronic Arts would inflict upon the gaming world.  You should especially check out tutorials for this game before you start playing it, because if you don't, you can expect quite a bit of trial and error in the building of your city, and that could end up costing you lots of money.  Especially make sure you read the manual, unless you want to look at the forums (or ask questions that were long since asked) about how to build elevated roads.\\n\\nThe game, however, is still plenty of good fun without any DLC's or custom content, so you can expect lots of fun times playing Cities: Skylines.  Just be sure to let your friends and family know they'll never hear from you again, and be prepared to stay up all night.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The latest update added a Launcher that does nothing positive for you. It just another layer for marketing AND tracking for a game from 2016. So far, it doesn't work on Linux and MacOS out of the Box (what it did before) and many Windows users also expierence problems. IF the launcher works, it takes an additional 2 to 5 minutes to load the game. Until now there is an unofficial way to remove this launcher and the game works as before just fine. The best part of this is the officals response. They are either mocking the community or remain silent. \\n\\n 1. Launcher is installed without question, hint or consent. Installation is outside the game directory!\\n 2. After the launcher is installed automatically, you must accept three new software agreements or otherwise you can not use the software anymore.\\n 3. With this launcher there is no offline mode\\n 4. Launcher is not managed by steam and reamains if you uninstall cities skylines or/and steam\\n 5. Some people have pointed out that this launcher has an integrated keylogger\\n[quote=roberto tomás;1742265315842171209]on a mac, it literally requests system-wide permission to log all keystrokes in any application. It is actually malware. [/quote]\\n 6. They are collecting data about sex, age, etc. (see the three agreeements) \\n 7. Store page is not giving any hint for this launcher or the new agreements\\n 8. The function of this launcher is unclear (by the way steam is a launcher). Consider that you can, for now, circumvent the launcher and the game still works. What is this launcher doing you might ask?\\n 9. Tencent is involved at Paradox (https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/)\\n10. 80 MB for piece of code to launch a game?\\n11. Many users report that the launcher is making the game crash like every 20 min. It also makes the game laggy. This is not what you could expect from a simple launcher.\\n12. There are reports, however unconfirmed, that the launcher is performing a local search on your computer (do you wonder why a simple launcher takes 2 to 5 minute to start a game that was starting much faster before?).\\n13. It seems that on Windwos ransomware protection is working.\\n[quote=Carlton BEaEnkEs, no E]When you play on Windows 10 you literally have to disable your ransomware protection, and they collect your information about your device. DO NOT INSTALL. [/quote]\\n\\n\\n14. outgoing connections to:\\nprod-telemetry.paradox-interactive.com (Amazon AWS server in USA)\\nbuffpanel.com (Host server cellense.com, in Netherlands)\\ncapture.trackjs.com (located in Canada)\\n\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1976349559\\n\\n\\nDon't get me wrong here.

       "  'review': \"If game updates weren't forced on us I'd gladly recommend this game, but since Steam doesn't give us a way to turn off forced updates then no, I can't recommend it because it NEEDS mods. It is a very clunky game without certain mods and every time they force us to update it breaks all of the good mods. Then even once they are update you can still expect to spend days chasing down errors to make the game playable again. If Steam would just let us hold off on the updates until we are ready this issue would be solved. I personally would wait a few months before updating to give all of the mods makers a chance to work out the bugs. Steam, you guys should really follow the update pattern set by Mojang. When Minecraft is updated they don't force it on us. We can decide when to update and we can switch back to any previous version at any time. I know that it might not be possible to switch back with any game, but just let us turn off the forced updates.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is pretty much much improved/fixed version of the latest SimCity, with some pros and cons of its own:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Maps are much bigger. Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.\\n\\n- Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don\\'t have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.\\n\\n- Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).\\n\\n- Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.\\n\\n- Pipes and power lines are back.\\n\\n- Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.\\n\\n- Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.\\n\\n- Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.\\n\\n- No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn\\'t cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn\\'t work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.\\n\\n- No landscaping tools.\\n\\n- Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.\\n\\n- Weather and time of day do not change.\\n\\n- Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.\\n\\n- Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the \"news ticker\" from SimCity.\\n\\n- Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.\\n\\n- Can\\'t view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.\\n\\n- All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.\\n\\n- Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should\\'ve been copied here.\\n\\nOverall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn\\'t feel like a couped up  tiny sandbox like SimCity.\\n\\nIts definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made. The only issue i\\'ve encountered so far is some sound stuttering.\\n\\nSo i can recommend this if you like city building games and were disappointed by every other game in the last few years.',\n",

It's amazing how you can detail your city, how you plan all your public transport system, how you manage all your city's needs, how you manage the traffic, and obviously how many mods and assets it have here on steam workshop. And aslo the DLCs (not all of them :| ) are just as good, like Green Cities, Mass Transit, Parklife, Industries (although I still haven't playet it yet) and Natural Disasters, but you can have an amazing experience playing with just the base game. I highly recommend it for everyone looking for a good simulation game, especially the ones like me that love city-building games.\",\n",

Day/night cycle, Snow, and natural disasters should not be $15 bucks each to have in the game.\\n\\nIf they came with some huge new features, I'd get it.  But a lot of it is patched in for free, so I'm not sure exactly what they expect me to pay for?  A snow map?  For $15?\\n\\nI dunno guys.  I do love the game, but you need to add more than superficial features to ask $15 USD.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'When writing this I have about 13h of playtime and the \"endgame\" is yet to be experienced, but so far I lack the words to describe the amount of joy this has given me. I always been a big fan och city builders and was a little worried that this one would not live up to my expectations, like some other games in the genre....\\n\\nBut boy this one delivers more then I could ever hope for, it\\'s only been out for a few days and it feels extremely well polished and the amount of effort put into the small details is amazing. Probably a quarter of the time I spent in my cities have been just enjoying how it looks and following the citizens around doing what they do. The agent system the citizens are based around works quite good and basically everything can be renamed, from people to buildings.\\n\\nIt is also possible to zone different regions in the city and give them individual focuses and different policies wich is an amazing feature that does alot for the immersion, and I would imagine could be awesome for those that likes to recreate irl cities.\\n\\nThe tools the game has available for creating roads is really solid to, personally I love to create spaghetti junctions and overly complicated networks that barely work and then try to fix them up. The traffic simulator is working and it feels like it responds to changes in the network quite well. Public transport for the game I have mixed feelings about, you have to manually create lines for busses, trains etc using a similar but less complicated system from Cities in Motion. This has the potential to be something really good but at the same a tedious task, and it makes me wish there were more tools to track groups of citizens travelling paths.\\n\\nI haven\\'t played around with mods and custom assets yet but the built in features seems to be really good and the steam workshop integration allows easy access to other peoples creations, some amazing mods for this is bound to happen.\\n\\nI could write alot more about this but I don\\'t have time... I want to get back to play it again!',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is a game I probably should\\'ve reviewed ages ago but never got around to it.\\n\\nCities Skylines is a great game and is basically the ONLY city builder out in the modern day that for the most part delivers. Though, if you\\'re a fan of the OG Sim City games, depending on what your expectations are coming into this game, you may or may not be disappointed. \\n\\nThis game, much like planet coaster to Roller Coaster tycoon 2 is that they manage to capture one beloved aspect of prior games and doesn\\'t do everything else that well.\\n\\nCities is great at just being a city builder. Through and through, it\\'s perfect. Beyond that though.. eh, it\\'s ok I suppose. The business aspect of actually managing a city is exist but it\\'s nowhere near as intricate or deep as Sim City and for some that may be a turn off. For me I grew up with the Sim City games so it was extremely disappointing to see how bare bones the system in this game is when it comes actually managing your city. To give an example, in Sim City you would have advisors that would tell you how to run your city, give suggestions etc etc. In Cities, you just get a little bird tweeter at the top to show your city as \"alive\" but in reality it\\'s nothing more then a puddle deep implementation of the system.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good game if you just come in wanting to build cities and not really have to worry about actually managing your city. If you want more then a surface level experience, this game will not deliver that. I am aware you can get mods to tweak and alter the gameplay to better suit what you might be looking for but, it will never be enough to truly alter/fix a core component of the game. That can only be done by the devs in hopefully the new Cities 2 coming out later this year.\\n\\nThank you for reading.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[i]Updated: 27-Mar-2020[/i]\\n\\nHands-down the best city simulator since [i]SimCity 4[/i]. Even with it's known issues, the amount of love poured into this game is obvious. There's also a vibrant and talented modding community with so much content in the Steam Workshop that you're bound to find any number of add-ons that will give your dream city that extra touch you're looking for. And if you feel overwhelmed, check out the tons of YouTube videos from experienced city builders to get new players started with the basics.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, traffic is the biggest issue with this game. I highly recommend the [i]Mass Transit[/i] DLC along with the base game at minimum. Some transit options are buried in DLC that are not transit related -- tram/light rail: [i]Snowfall[/i], bicycle lanes and taxis: [i]After Dark[/i], etc -- but these aren't showstoppers. There's also excellent mods that address some of the short-comings of the traffic AI, different road size and placement options and -- most critically -- mods that allow you to fine-tune road segments post-placement for that polished look that you can't get otherwise.\\n\\nI highly suggest looking at videos and articles that explain how to best design your road systems in order to not have a hair-ripping traffic experience. Smart road placement, junction control, and city/district polices that suppress or encourage certain kinds of traffic all come into use here.\\n\\nAnd speaking of videos, there's tons of them on just about any aspect of the game. Want to learn how to make maps of real locations? Strategies for building on hilly terrain? How to efficiently plan your subways? Several people have probably made a tutorial or ten about each.\\n\\nAlthough the game is approaching five years old, Colossal Order is still pumping out DLC. It's important to note, however, that they are not doing it like other simulation franchises that merely offer new assets to plop on your map. The focus of the DLCs are on new behavior and features. If you're looking for new assets, the workshop is where you go. Between these two resources, the game is practically its own sequel since its original release.\\n\\n[b]Rating: 9/10\\nIf you build it, they will come.[/b]\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]A City Builder / Management Strategy Game[/h1]\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pweCVggk1DU\\n+ Extremely addicting gameplay.  Honestly, this is the type of game you can play all day without getting bored as build a vibrant city. \\n+ Easy to learn with very intuitive menues, and features that slowly unlock as your city builds. There really isn\\'t need for any tutorials, you will learn as you play.\\n+ Visually the game looks gorgeous, and it is a delight to go into camera-mode and just watch as your city thrives. You can even see your people as they go about their daily tasks. What is most surprising is the variety of buildings / houses / stores that are built, and they all look great.\\n+ Day / Night Cycle and Weather to add a further sense of emersion.\\n+ Challenging, you have a budget which you have to constantly keep an eye on. Every so often you will have growing pains, where you may suddenly run out of power or water, or perhaps a building will catch on fire, or perhaps the crime rate goes up or you run out of garbage trucks, or maybe a giant traffic jam. You have to be ready to deal with all these issues and more while trying to manage a steady tax rate and keep people from getting unhappy and moving out.\\n+ You can buy addional plots of land and build multiple HUGE thriving cities\\n+ Steam Workshop with a bunch of new buildings and scenerios\\n\\n- The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of pre-build scenerios or \"challenge levels / missions\". The main goal seems to be to just grow as large you possibly can, and then start over.\\n- The road system could be improved a bit. It\\'s a bit difficult to make neat and uniform roads with proper exits. On top of this, building various road types and highways is VERY expensive making it difficult to improve areas with dense congested traffic.\\n\\nSide Note: If you were wondering, Yes this game is far greater than Sim City',\n",

       "  'review': \"In this game, you get to build your own city from the ground up, making decisions on what to build, where to build it, and how to manage your resources. There's a ton of different buildings and structures to choose from, ranging from residential houses and apartment buildings to commercial businesses, industrial facilities, and more.\\n\\nOne of the things I really like about Cities: Skylines is how it gives you a lot of control over your city's infrastructure. You can build roads, set up public transportation, and even manage your city's water and power systems. It can get pretty complex, but it's also a lot of fun figuring out the best ways to keep your citizens happy and your city running smoothly.\\n\\nAnother plus is the game's graphics. The buildings and landscapes look really good, and it's fun to watch your city grow and change over time. There's also a pretty active online community, with lots of mods and custom content available to download and use in your own cities.\\n\\nOne of the downsides of this game is the learning curve. This game does not come with any ingame tutorials, other than the advisor hints, so failure is inevitable. That can be a bit overwhelming for beginners, especially for those who are just starting out with city-building or management games. \\n\\nOverall, I'd say Cities: Skylines is a solid choice for anyone who's into management games. Just be warned, it can be pretty addictive once you get started!\",\n",

It is a great game, but don't waste your time on it until it has definitive/gold edition with all the game packs included at a fair one time price... Seriously paying $20 and another $20 for some new buildings and weather effects or some disasters???

       "  'review': \"!This game cointains spyware!\\n\\nI loved playing this, but since a recent update I had to accept a new privacy policy which I disagree with. Probably they had to do this due to new European privacy laws, so I assume non-EU gamers did not get this prompt. But that probably just means they don't tell you what info they are collecting (and sharing with third parties). Anyway, not agreeing to the privacy policy means not being able to play anymore. \\n\\nData collection consists of analysis of hardware and software. No boundaries are mentioned there, so your entire harddrive is up for grabs. They also like to take a look at what games you own, what you play, when and how long you play and while they're at it, Paradox will also look over your shoulder while you are playing. This makes me very uncomfortable.\\n\\nOther info they collect which I consider private, unlikely to serve to improve the product and also completely irrelevant to share with their third parties:\\n[list]\\n[*] my location information \\n[*] my gender\\n[*] payment and transaction data\\n[*] Steam ID\\n[*] Multiplayer sessions, when played and who with\\n[*] ..and a couple more things\\n[/list]\\n\\nThis will be shared with Facebook and Google (and at least 10 other commercial parties). If you don't have an account there, don't worry, this should give them plenty of info to make an account for you. \\n\\nCiv6 (and many other games) had Red Shell implemented, which was also a type of spyware. It caused outrage and then it got removed due to the negative reviews. Let's hope we can convince Paradox to make the same call. But it requires you to write a review.\\n\\nMaybe this a new way for the gaming industry to generate money because the lootboxes are now illegal in the EU and since DLC's aren't as cool anymore. But I bought this game with money, I don't want to also pay with my private info.\\n\\n[i]Update: I rewrote this. Same story, just a little less bad to read ;) [/i]\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities Skylines is said to be a \"modern take on the classic city simulation\" and after playing around for many hours, it is on that path and it\\'s the best we have of a new modern city building simulator, and it\\'s the best we will probably have for a while.\\n\\nThis is, to an extent, the city building game we\\'ve been waiting for, at least the best one we\\'re going to get that\\'s is satisfying, not buggy, not overly restricting, but one that\\'s made with care, that\\'s free from tiny shackles, with freedom and space to have creativity built in it, and one that\\'s design nicely, combined with support for community support.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHbfMpcvEuk\\n\\nThe look of the game is decently great, at least better looking that a rehashed game for the third time, but lowers than a heavily funded one. it\\'s working, compared to other recent city builders, it has minimal bugs, runs smoothly, even hours after playing the game with a lot of structures being built. The restrictions on the game at its peek is minimal, exponentially smaller than a triple-A produced game of recent years, with the ability to remove all restrictions.\\n\\nThe gameplay is slick and smoother, with normal decent controls and a good UI, and an even more detailed view of finer data like the space need to build a structure alongside a road, a better resource and feedback view, and other new elements introduced like noise pollution with elements and tools at hand to counter it. The game uses a nice system of the industry type zoning, with placing them in specific types of land with resources, and then applying the type of work they do with the use of the district painting tool. Certainly a new way of production that I haven\\'t seen before, and it\\'s kind of nice and sort of makes some sense instead of having just one building produce one specific type in mass.\\n\\nThe transportation and traffic controls in the game is real and it packs a punch, as it was created by the same developers who made Cities In Motion 1 & 2, which was mainly focused and is specialized on the transportation systems. So if you don\\'t have a nice road map for you city, you will probably have issues with other cervices doing their jobs and as a result having more issues to deal with, which is great.\\n\\nThe problems with the game consist of the game not teaching you well enough on how the systems work, but you I managed to learn almost everything to make a decently big city on my second playthrough. My first time playing the game was arguably created a horrible city, but my second playthrough was a lot nicer after having all the experience and knowledge I gained from my first go at it, and at this point it\\'s fine tuning with my third time at creating a nice city. Not a problem, more of a nit picky thing, the monuments in the game where mediocre in it\\'s scale and design, as I wasn\\'t overwhelmed by it\\'s looks or scale. Plus, the game doesn\\'t have any sort of flying services, which left me heavily focusing on my structural groundwork immensely more so I don\\'t screw up later on and damage my city.\\n\\nOverall Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder that I and many others needed, from the glorious days of the past, to the disappointments of modern times concerning a nice city builder, SC brings joy and hope that we finally get to have in this genre, for the asking price and for what you get and what you will get later on with support for community support, this is a definite good purchase.\\n\\nShameless [url=http://ksalue.com/_/review/my-thoughts-on-cities-skylines-review-r719]link[/url] to original post',\n",

       "  'review': \"I get a kick out of people who dislike this game, and yet have sixty to a hundred hours of game play.  Obviously they are employees of Maxis.\\n  Two years ago I was amused by this game and really enjoyed it.  Having now played with Mass Transit, I am amazed by what I see the cims do.  This game really works!!  You just have to plan. \\n  People complain about traffic in this game.  Well, I live in California and notice while I am driving around Angels Camp, and other foothill communities there is not much traffic!, but when I drive in San Francisco or L.A.  there is an overwhelming amount of traffic.  1+1 =   Pretty much goes with the population.\\n   I decided to go with just low residential on my map and I first began with bus routes through those communities dropping them off at schools, commercial districts and clean industry areas.  I noticed they RODE the busses and I made good money!\\nNext I did trams on the out skirts and inner areas of those residential areas and noticed they rode the trams!\\n  I LOVE monorails! I always have.  When I finally was able to use monorails,  I decided to make a tourist area and then I plopped down the harbor for passengers.  It works in this game.  The tourists came.  I brought the monorail to them, having HUGE bus lines from the city in the central hub.  They use it!  My busses are organized and no traffic!\\n   I got the airport.  Obviously, I brought the monorail to it.  I have seven monorail lines around my city!  I have nearly 50 bus lines.  I MAKE my tourists use the trams, because when they get off the monorails, it's too LONG to walk to the tourist area, so they go to the center of the road and get on the trams, which go to different tourist areas!!  \\n    This game is FUN!  Thankfully I watched a video and he reccommended ALWAYS use four lane roads, because they are easily upgradeable!  Best advice I could share also.\\n    Mass Transit!  It's what it promises!  My monorails are FULL!  They WAIT in line for the Trams!  And they wait in line for the busses when they get off in the MAIN Monorail HUB, which has four lines servicing it!!  I tinker with the monorails, trams and busses.  EASY to see if a line needs more!  Some lines are PACKED!  I decided to put in the Space Elevator!  OMG!  LOL.  I had to put in 3 more monorails on that line to take the passengers and four more trams! \\n \\n   LOVE the game!  Thanks so much for your efforts!  I appreciate them and see what you have made.  Fun!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It is a pretty fun game, but the constant bother of having to focus on traffic? It's my only, core, sole reason for why i haven't played this game 4x as much. In true reality, people won't always drive the fastest way to their destination. People drive way smarter if there are more paths to their destination. But in this game? There can be 8 paths to where you wanna go, but ALL of the drivers ONLY DESIRE to use 3 paths max. The lack of realism from the driver/traffic perspective really pull the game down for me and some other players.\\n\\nIn the end? I don't want to play a traffic management simulator, that's literally not the title of the game and so why hasn't this been addressed more by the developers? You can spend 5 hours designing a city smart, then spend 10 more hours adjusting roads. Then your roads clog up again.......\\n\\nI'll be honest, that's not a fun game to play. It's not. Which is pretty irritating when the game plays amazingly, looks gorgeous, has TONS of very good content all across, can be modded as well, has lots of broad depth via design you can take on, ETC ETC ETC.\\n\\nALL overshadowed by having to fix the sheer lack of very very very VERY BASIC pathing-AI or the lack of.\\nBut what do i know?

       "  'review': \"*edited 3/27/2020\\nPlease note this is my personal experience with the original launcher as many of the comments state many issues have been addressed. Due to the Virus of 2020 and being in the IT field, my attention is needed else were for better or worse I will re visit this as soon as I get a break.\\n\\n*edited 3/6/2020 \\n-  Original Post\\nI love this game and had planned to purchase every DLC, yet once the launcher happened i refuse to support Paradox Interactive. Not only does their launcher reside outside of steam you cannot uninstall it and run the game normally. There is a simple and safe way to have steam launch the game without the launcher installed, but I choose not to support them because they try to auto-subscribe you to their YouTube, force EULA for the launcher, Require a useless Paradox Interactive account with no simple way to cancel. I for one have blacklisted the launcher with my A/V just in case.\\n\\nAll in all, I love CS and will continue to play, however I will never buy from such an appalling company which puts money and stats above integrity and their customers.\\n\\nGood Bye Paradox Interactive\\n\\n- For Clarification\\n\\nWhile I can't speak for the others but from a security standpoint having something auto installed without my knowledge and not providing a decline or opt-out option; In today 'n age isn't a very smart idea which is why people are classifying it as malware. \\n\\nAlso having it install outside of the steam game lib. presents a direct security threat as it can not be validated by steam, in fact steam has not control over it let alone manage it.\\n\\n( my direct option here) It would seem that steam would blindly download the launcher and auto install it at launch of CS;, hopefully there would be some safety checks but who knows.\\n( enough techy bable )\\n\\nI also literally got unsubscribe from their YouTube; I highlight this because I was already subscribed and their launcher tried to auto sub me ( which back fired) you shouldn't make choices for people  IMO\\n\\nSimply put, I saw a slowdown on my PC after its install and in launching the game. All that aside I do plan to re visit it and if it is indeed an improvement I'll adjust my review.\\n\\nI personally don't approve of it unless they take out the main menu and make the launcher just that a central place to control the start of the game.\\n\\n-That's all folks\",\n",

       "  'review': \"(Edit: The gameplay of this game is good and Colossal Order has done a fantastic job.  However the issues I talk about below, and a now very intrusive EULA, keep the review as is, based on the cost to content ratio.  At a much lower price, I might recommend it, or with some basic DLC, like disasters, included in a well-priced bundle, but currently, I believe the customer is being taken advantage of - especially now that they collect your data and sell it.)\\n\\nSame as most others, I am disappointed by Paradox's choice to release DLC packs for what really should have been updates or even included with the base game at launch.  To top it off, the DLC is priced on the high end comparative to what you get for each one.\\n\\nReally... Disasters are a paid-for DLC.  Disasters have been included in city building games since SimCity way back 30 years ago.  This is not a new concept that should be additional paid-for DLC.\\n\\nThe game could have been awesome - and even fitting to have valuable paid-for DLC worth purchasing - however, the way they stripped out so many basic features in favor of offering these at an additional premium really leaves a bad impression.  It is like playing a Free to Play game with features behind a paywall, except, you have to pay for the base game too.  Sort of twisted.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I was afraid this game wouldn't be beginner friendly considering how much creative freedom it gives you. Based on that assumption, I bought the game at a low price and let it sit in my library. That was a mistake.\\n\\nThis game makes you very aware what minor mistakes you make when you're learning the basics and gives lets of guide popup tips. I'll put it this way, it's hard to make a bad city and it's hard to make a city that runs at 100% efficiency. Your first couple attempts at building a city are  probably going to be in the middle in terms of greatness, but you'll get the basics down as you experiment.\\n\\nThe city menus take a little while to get used to, but this is a very good game. The game truly gives you the freedom to build whatever type of city you want. I'm having so much fun with my first city that I'm probably going to pick up 1 or 2 DLC packs while they are on sale.\\n\\nHighly Recommended.\",\n",

The extra policies, districts, industrial zone types, and various other features come together so perfectly, I honestly am in constant shock how everything ebbs and flows so well in an orchestra of harmony. This game is completely bug free (so far), has the production value of a AAA studio, beautiful music, pretty graphics, mod support, extremely well optimized, and water physics (for awesome some reason).\\n\\nI have not played a game I thoroughly enjoyed in probably 2 years; until this game came along. I am so happy I finally have a game I can enjoy once again. Thank you Paradox, thank you.\\n\\nSeriously, if you love citybuilders or strategy games, GET THIS.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Probably one of my most-played games, and for good reason. It's got quite a learning curve to a) build a city that functions and b) build something that looks GOOD, but with time (and lots of YouTube tutorials) you can start to build something that feels right. Mod support is plentiful, though some things feel downright essential when playing, such as the MoveIt mod, which helps with the very finicky road-building tools the base game provides.\\n\\nI do have some qualms with the DLC -- without adding them on the base game feels like it's pretty... empty. There are a lot of things that feel like they should be included from the get-go, especially some of the mass-transit add-ins of newer packs like Sunset Harbor. The DLCs are not required and you can still have fun without them, but a lot of the new features added by them make the game a lot more enjoyable. Figuring out which ones appeal to you is probably for the best -- I'm a sucker for building massive tram networks so the Snowfall DLC is a must-buy for me, but maybe you're more of a monorail guy, so you should get Mass Transit (which doesn't include trams for some reason?). Check YouTube playthroughs and see if anyone uses a pack that really strikes your fancy. Some of the newer DLC packs have AMAZING starting maps too, which sadly aren't free.\\n\\nOverall a really fun game, even if there are a lot of little frustrations in the design (especially wrt mixed-use zoning or the lack of middle density). Mods can help a lot, as can the DLC, but hoo boy are all the DLC together expensive. Don't bother with the radio packs, though.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\\n\\nI come from a long, proud line of urban planners. My father is an urban planner, as was his father, and his father before him (his father's father's father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation). But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”\\n\\nSo I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.\\n\\nI built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.\\n\\nPerhaps my father had a point.\\n\\nOh, an achievement unlocked!\\n\\nBad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.\\n\\nFuck.\\n\\nI guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”\\n\\nAnd so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.\\n\\nCities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.\\n\\nWith every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.\\n\\nDespite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.\\n\\nThere's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum. \\n\\nAnd then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is really fun for a bit, but it's had some core problems since launch and hasn't improved significantly.\\n\\nThe modding community has added some great missing features, but the mods are often brittle and hard to debug when things go wrong.\\n\\nThere's still a hard-coded limit of how many citizens are simulated at any given time, even if you have a powerful computer that could simulate more. So if you build a large city, it actually gets easier to manage transit beyond a certain point, because the maximum number of simulated citizens is spread out over a larger and larger area, leaving your roads and trains more and more deserted.\\n\\nThe traffic simulation is still notorious for having miles of backups in one lane. You can micromanage around it by using mods to specify which lanes should go where, but it's tedious and imperfect.\\n\\nAlmost all of the DLC has just added more content into a broken game, rather than fixing the underlying mechanics. I would love to buy more DLC just to support ongoing development, but only if development was actually still happening.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've played over 2000 hours of this game, yet I don't recommend it.\\n\\nWhy? Because it promises in-depth gameplay, hyped by a committed community of talented artists and constantly pumped full of life by talented modders... But the reality is that it is a highly surface level simulation that leaves too many itches unscratched, even with millions of mods.\\n\\nFor instance... \\n- The single use zoning aspect of the game essentially locks you into North American style planning, with a CBD and sprawling suburbs. Outside of public services and utilities, you can only place single buildings, or relocate them on a lot, by using mods that slow your game and clutter your menus.\\n- The property value system means that if you've provided enough services, every residence becomes a gentrified highrise and every commercial building becomes a skyscraper - there are no controls for this.\\nTo control the aesthetics of your city, you need to download GBs of modded assets, and then deselect the assets you don't want and select the ones you do. It's incredibly time consuming and tedious.\\n- There are unhappiness, policy and tax features that don't really do anything, but could have easily brought deeper complexity to the game.\\n- The maps begin as blank fields, more akin to suburban parks than any wilderness you'd find, or rural district. Creating wilderness maps is tedious, especially in balancing terrain - rivers are generally lined by cliffs. If you want hills in your city, you have to also be happy with the building graphics failing to adapt.\\n- Industry and demand is too abstract, with commercial demand being entirely random, so a sim will travel 2 hrs across the map for 'food', instead of to the nearest shop.\\n- it's incredibly tedious, nigh impossible, to simulate realistic (or even idealistic) looking agriculture,\\n- There is no need to emulate historic city growth, aesthetically or realistically - no need for fresh water, you start with cars but not trains, trucks but not ports, etc. The game demands you build a modern car-oriented city and you will struggle to implement anything else. The game refuses to let you operate at a human scale - you can easily throw down train lines and free ways, but all of the ways that these concepts impact us as city dwellers is washed away.\\n\\nI could write a book on all the issues I had with this game...\\n\\nMods help the game immensely, but they also slow it down, make it immensely tedious, and make it unstable. They make the game very taxing for PCs, and you will often lag fairly early into your city building experience. They also trying to combat deeply ingrained mechanics, rather than work with them - you can't mod out terrible design.\\n\\nIn my opinion, much like many Total Wars and like the Elder Scrolls series, this is a good 'base' of a game that is severely lacking in thought and depth, and needed longer in development to have its kinks ironed out. I am hoping a sequel to this game would have significantly deeper mechanics that offer more control to the player and more realism and context as to why cities are built they way they are.\",\n",

In Cities: Skylines you actually need to plan your city logically. Traffic, pollution, healthcare, deathcare, fire safety, police safety, and disaster safety all matter.\\n\\nA city can be crippled poorly designed intersection(s) and logistics. This can lead to several outcomes. A fire may take out your industry if fire trucks cannot reach the location. Pollution can make people sick. If these sick people die they must be taken to a cemetary. I think it is fun to design cities that effectively mitigate most of these things. Each gameplay is different for me. This is especially true if you play with random disasters. I would recommend this as it certainly adds character to your city and its design.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Building a city can be difficult. Nobody expects you to succeed in this already lively world packed to the brim with popular and famous cities. It won't be easy, you'll need to start small and work your way up, but if you plan ahead, budget popular, and take care of those who enter to call your city home, good things will come in time.\\n\\nLet's start from the beginning. You’re thrown into the chaos of financial and structural management immediately, with no tutorial missions or levels. But that's fine because it won't take longer for you to get into the game and it's mechanics. Cities: Skylines is developer Colossal Order’s first meaningful foray into the genre. A developer better known for their transportation simulation games with the Cities in Motion series, one would think that a city-building simulation game is a pretty natural progression. One would be exactly right in thinking this as Cities: Skylines is magnificent. There’s no point trying to hide it, because it just is. Cities: Skylines is just how a city-building simulator should be. If you despised SimCity for its tiny scale, this is not a tiny game. Skylines begins small, but as your city grows, you're able to unlock more and more of the surrounding countryside. It gets to the point where you can start building satellite communities just for the hell of it, because your primary city is so damn big.\\n\\nNow I don’t want to give people the impression that Cities: Skylines is re-inventing the wheel for the city-building genre. If anything, they are merely improving and tweaking the wheel to fit modern standards so that we are no longer consigned to playing games made more than a decade ago for a good city-building sim.\\n\\nOne of these things is the fact that the amount of land your city encompasses isn’t just limited to the 2km x 2km square that you start with. You get to “buy” more adjacent land tiles to eventually encompass 36 square kilometers of land, and that’s without mods that can bring it up to 25 tiles or 100 square kilometers. Another interesting thing they’ve done is uncouple the idea of commercial and office buildings. Commercial buildings are like shops, departments stores and cinemas, which historically was jumbled up with office buildings. Now they are two separate things, thus allowing you, the player, a lot more freedom when it comes to deciding how your city will be laid out.  Speaking of districts, that’s also another pretty cool feature that Cities: Skylines brings to the table. You can now draw out what constitutes a district and actually give it a name. \\n\\nCities: Skylines also does a good job of pacing the development of your town, Most things will be locked and unavailable to build in your town until certain milestones, usually populations size, are met. This is good on many levels as it prevents you from over-investing in infrastructure and services that you can barely afford as it is. \\n\\nThen there are some features that are missing that one would probably expect or highly desire in a city-building sim like a day and night cycle. Say what you want about the 2013 SimCity, but it was pretty cool to watch streetlights go on and off and your sims go about their daily businesses and participate in rush hours.\\n\\nCities: Skylines is how city-building games ought to be. It’s fun, it’s pretty, it’s easily approachable, yet, difficult to master. It doesn’t have all the features that one might dream of in the perfect city-building simulator like a day-night cycle or swathes of data and statistics to comb through when optimizing your city, but it does absolute wonders with the features it does have.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Teal Deer[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*][b]Developers:[/b] Colossal Order Ltd. \\n[*][b]Publishers:[/b] Paradox Interactive \\n[*][b]Initial release:[/b] March 2015\\n[*][b]Genre:[/b] Simulation, City Builder \\n[*][b]#Worth/NotWorth:[/b] #Worth\\n[/list]\\n[h1]Exposition, Concurrence and Summation[/h1]\\nCities: Skylines is a city builder and economy simulator in the vain of the oh so fallen from grace SimCity. \\n\\n[b]Skylines[/b] is essentially a sandbox for you to plan out, build certain amenities and hopefully people will want to move in and make your city thrive. \\n\\nInitially when you first jump into the game it starts with many of the options grayed out and it sort of gates you in this manner as you get used to the basics of building roads and zoning out areas as well as providing electricity, water and sewage treatment facilities. Then, as things unlock such as healthcare facilities and schools, you'll be able to get a better grasp of each system. \\n\\nYou'll have access to crime, fire safety reports. As well as noise and actual pollution overlays. Should you desire to “go green” the use of wind turbines are also available as well as a corresponding wind chart for peak efficiency. \\n\\nThe game makes use of a relatively humorous but sometimes annoying fake twitter for your citizens to @mention you and tell what you're doing wrong and in rare cases what you are doing right. At least in my experience. \\n\\nYou can inact policies like water preservation or power conservation and even things like mandatory smoke alarms in homes. Typically, at the cost of increased upkeep while decreasing use of resources or in this specific case the likelihood of fire even though that's not technically what fire alarms do. This is how the game “gameifies” that sentiment. \\n\\n[b]Anecdotal experience warning[/b]\\nThere are weather effects and a day/night cycle. Which led to a moment I don't often have in gaming that was slightly existential. For setup, I was early on in my learning the game and had not really understood how to get things going faster when the first night struck. Without power, without people living in my city, it was entirely pitch black; And I had this rather obvious realization the more I think about it but at the time was borderline transcendental though I'm not fond of the connotations of that word; I was sat there “We really are just floating on a rock out in space”. As though this was not already obvious to everyone. This just seemed like a very odd and probably the least likely of places or style of game for someone to have that thought process. Let alone in a game at all. \\n[b]Anyways, back on point[/b]\\n\\nThe game also features mod and steam workshop support which leads to nearly endless types of buildings and other various ideas that modders can come up with. \\n\\nThere is also economy and budget screens to adjust taxes on different districts or different zones. As well as increase or decrease funding of maintenance on city utilities and services. \\n\\nIf I had anything bad to say about the game is that it is not always overtly clear how to do something. It requires a lot of tooling around and experimenting.  In a very specific example setting up bus routes is rather ill contrived, at times down right purposely misleading in its functionality. Though a tutorial on proper usage can easily be sought out if need be outside the game. \\n\\nIt also features what I'd consider a fairly unique aesthetic. It does indeed have a film grain slider. Which when combined with the depth of field and lighting gives this almost physical model like appeal.  Like it's a table in your basement with your model trains running along it. Zooming in, if you just look down a street it almost feels alive. I want to invoke the powers of Mr. Rodgers here but I fear the reference may be lost among the traffic. \\n\\n[b]THE GIST\\nSuperb city builder that scratches the niche of well done and in-depth simulation that many games seem to miss.[/b]\\n\\n[quote]More here — [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28295405/]Station Argus[/url][/quote]\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is the first city builder simulator that I have player, EVER. The reason behind it is because I tend to be very bad at organizing my priorities in games such as this. Too many factors to take into account. Too many different things that could, and will, go wrong if you're not careful. It's just who I am. For whatever reason, probably a price drop and the good reviews, I decided to purchase the game. At first I was a complete mess, lost doing the simplest things, but instead of abandoning it as I would have a few months ago, I decided to look for some tips on youtube, and then a few guides. I was hyped that you could do so much with the city and started playing and building randomly at first, trying out stuff I had seen. Some of it worked, some of it didn't. \\n\\nThe thing is, I started to like what I used to hate about these type of simulators. When my city didn't work anymore, I built a new city and started again. I think now I have the hold of most of the basics and I'm ready to move on to the next step! Maybe buying another slot. I've been talking so much about this game that I even convinced one of my friends to get it!\\n\\nSummary: if I could learn to play, so can you! You won't regret it :)\",\n",

The game is relaxing and engaging with pretty good performance if you consider the complexity involved in rendering a complete simulation of a modern city.

       "  'review': 'TL;DR: sandbox game for creative players. If your creativity is channeled through problem-solving, then this game will leave you wanting.\\n\\n\\nI have tried so hard to like the game.\\n\\nHands-down, technically the [u]best city-builder since Sim City 4[/u]. The problem is: I don\\'t have the urge to come back to it. 5 hours in, lack of interest settles in, I just give up and start over. Rince and repeat. I [i]can\\'t find the fun[/i] though I\\'m looking hard.\\n\\nTherefore it\\'s aimed at [i]creative[/i] players, who just play on unlimited resources and invest time in designing a beautiful city.\\n\\nLack of challenge makes you fail to see the point of anything after a couple hours. \"Ok, I can improve traffic, but what\\'s the point, people still come to my city and budget is fine anyway\". \"Criminality? Okay, whatever. Budget\\'s fine\".\\n\"Cool, I can fine tune the budget with all the sliders!... I can make tax-free zones for specific industries!... but I don\\'t care and won\\'t ever use it because there\\'s absolutely no point\".\\n\\nIf you\\'re the kind of person who just wants to design stuff, then you\\'ll have a blast. If you channel your creativity through problem-solving, then boredom will settle in quickly.\\n\\nIf you\\'re anything like me, then you will find that there\\'s no point in moving away from the \"grid\" city-design. Every block is a square, crossroads are crosses, because that\\'s the more efficient choice. So if you\\'re a problem solver, all your cities will look the same.\\nThat may sound stupid to Americans, but here in old Europe, cities have grown organically over the course of millenias: cars are barely allowed in medieval city centers, which have tons of pedestrians-only walkways; low-rent flats are usually in the cities\\' outskirts; then, further away, the big business center with highrises, accessible by road or public transportation, built in a very windy spot or on an old marsh, because that\\'s the only spot where our ancestors didn\\'t build anything...\\n\\nI dream of the day a city-builder will have us build a city through the ages. Imagine the challenges! Your 1200 AD city needs wall for defense, but cannons will soon render this useless and you\\'ll be left with crumbling walls dividing your city between center and outskirts. Industrial revolution comes around and now you need housing for workers, railroads for supply: means you have to burn down some of those outskirts houses and decide what to do with their poor inhabitants... Enters XXth cenury, in order allow cars into the city you need larger avenues, so then again you need more space! Residents won\\'t be happy... Then, fast-forward 2010, there is so much traffic that you need to reshape everything around cycling and public transportation...\\n\\nYou could choose to start in the New World around 1600 AD, where challenges are entirely different...\\n\\nIf you built your city originally on a marsh, or trapped between mountains, or in windy plains, then you would have different challenges and opportunities, renewed every new era.\\n\\nNow, THAT would keep me playing till 4am. Cities: Skylines? Sadly, no.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This was the best citysim to come out in the 2010s. Cities: Skylines not only towered above EA\\'s perfunctory 2013 SimCity reboot, it stood up with the all time classics of that series, striking a balance between SimCity 3000\\'s accessibility and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/24780]SimCity 4[/url]\\'s depth. That\\'s to say nothing of how redundant it rendered the samey Cities XL series. The base game is alright by itself, but not only are there already more DLCs and expansions than SimCity 4 ever got, Steam Workshop integration makes finding and using player-created mods ten times easier than it was for SimCity 4.\\n\\nThe only real problems I can think of are that there isn\\'t much of a tutorial for new players - they just get interface popups every time they start a new city - that the user interface isn\\'t quite as intuitive as in the classic SimCity games, and that some of the expansions/DLCs are rather expensive yet light on content. The learning curve problems can be overcome with time and perhaps an internet guide or two, and community reviews can alert you to what DLCs are worth it or not. The DLCs also go on sale semi-frequently.\\n\\nI have three main criticisms of the gameplay itself; not enough to sink the game, but noticeable things that are worth downloading mods to address.\\n\\n* The first is the way the game handles industrial traffic: in the real world, a fair portion of it is shipped by rail, but in this game, it\\'s mainly sent by road, which absolutely clogs up your road system beyond the traffic an industrial area would normally produce in real life.\\n\\n* Even with all the DLCs that have been added to the game, Skylines still lacks a key tenet of modern urban planning, which is mixed use zoning. Without it, the game struggles that much harder to get out from under the shadow of the outmoded 1950s/60s urbanist planning mindset that SimCity generally modeled. I suppose with that in mind, the store blurb isn\\'t lying when it says the game is a \\'modern\\' take on the \\'classic\\' citybuilder. Other than this, it\\'s still a fun experience.\\n\\n* A third issue is that the game charges you with delivering the corpses of your dead citizens to cemeteries and crematoriums, and every so often your city will go through \"death waves\" where a bunch of people die at once, because immigration to your city tends to come from waves of people who are around the same age. You end up needing more deathcare buildings than real cities have, especially since in real life, it\\'s generally not something city governments do in the first place.\\n\\n\\nThose are still ultimately minor blemishes on an otherwise good game, and for people new to city simulators, I\\'d say this is the best you could possibly do apart from going over to GOG and picking up SimCity 3000. While some of the expansions add goal-oriented scenarios, the meat of the game is in freeform city building. It gives you more freedom than any previous citysim did while maintaining the experience of managing a city, and for people who just want to make things look pretty, there\\'s a built-in infinite money option that removes budget worries.\\n\\nFor people who are already familiar with classics like SimCity 4, you frankly probably already own this game, but a rundown here won\\'t hurt you any. It\\'s generally a worthy successor, and the easier modding alone makes it worth picking up if you haven\\'t for some reason. It adds a couple of the EA reboot\\'s better features, principally freeform roads and optional resource extraction. More attention must be paid to traffic logistics, given that public services now actually utilize your road system, and perennial traffic jams kind of make it hard for garbage trucks to make their rounds, as just one example. Sewage also must be dumped back out somewhere - hopefully not in the same place your water pump is taking input. The in-game radio stations are neat, and a couple of the DLC ones even have jazz reminiscent of SimCity\\'s music.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to close by saying how great it is that there\\'s an entire expansion dedicated to \"green cities\" and climate sustainability. Even if it is paid content, the mere thought counts for a lot. The main game, at least, is well worth trying out.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Setup a \"Recreational Use\" drug policy on my residential district. Best. Game. Ever.\\n\\nIn all seriousness though, this game is a great city builder. Better than Sim City 2013 and much better than the last two Cities XL games. There is mod support right away, you can expand your city to be much much larger, the gameplay is fun, it handles well, runs well and its a blast to play. Sure the art design could be better (seems like a cheap sc 2013 style art design), sure I miss the night and day cycle from SC and there are some bugs with drivers ai and some other stuff but overall those pale compared to all the things this game does right. Want to create a big gigantic city? You have come to the right game!\\n\\nGet your hands on this wonderfully crafted game and you won\\'t be dissapointed. There is alot of options for customization, I can see hundreds of hours being spent on this game down the road, well done devs! Two big thumbs up from me, as this is the most fun I have had building stuff in a videogame since Simcity 4 and the last Anno game. This is a wonderful base game as is and for the future, I can see mods and expansion packs adding more and more down the road to.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Just buy it (on sale if you're not sure)... So much talent and passion behind this game.  The technical complexity of the simulation is amazing, the pricing is perfectly on point.  Checkout the workshop and have your mind blown.\\n\\nThe DLC in my opinion is a way for the developers to reward themselves further of the blood, sweat, and tears they pour into this game.  People often forget that when a DLC comes out, the base game receives free huge content updates and back-end fixes, extended mod support, etc.   The DLC often go on sale as well just like the base game.  \\n\\nYou may have paid $60 for SimCity 5 for a water-downed simulation/pretty game.. So far I've spent ~$30 total with all DLCs and this game has added more enjoyment than all city sims before it combined..  I've been playing since Simcity Classic and SimCity 2000!  Fuck I'm getting old.\\n\\nEDIT 2-28-2019:  I also would like to mention that these types of simulation/tycoon games have more niche followings and DLC's allow them to support the developers yearly income years after the game released vs pushing out $60 copies every 2 years that are made from scratch and compromise on features.  After all, Colossal Order is only ~17 employees.  The mods alone for this game give it amazing unlimited value without the DLCs\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So this is a hard decision whether or not to recommend this game. Ultimately I have to say no. Here\\'s the reason:\\n\\ntl:dr: the longer you play the more you play against the shortcomings of the game\\'s engine and AI which is something the developers are expressively not going to fix. The DLC all add new content of varying quality which let you build ever more beautiful cities, but doing so will shorten you life by several years because of rage induced heart failure. /tl;dr\\n\\n\\nFirst this game starts as a city builder and it\\'s great at that. It\\'s really the best city builder out there at the moment. Up to this point (a city of 30-40k inhabitants) I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It\\'s gorgeous and motivating and everything you can possibly hope for in a game like this.\\nBut somewhere around that mark the genre of this game shifts and it\\'s no longer a city builder, but a traffic manager. And oh boy does it suck at that. First and foremost and completely unfixable: The traffic AI sucks! The driver\\'s decisions are so mind-boggling that you constantly sit in front of your screen jaw dropped in disbelief. In other words it\\'s not about managing traffic but trying to find a way to play the AI, fixing it\\'s inadequacy by means of road design. But you don\\'t get the tools for that. Managing lanes? Nope. Needs a mod. Directing trains with signal lights? Nope, not possible. Getting info whether or not some industry is in the reach of a cargo station? Nope, that\\'s a secret. But in the end you don\\'t even want traffic to shift onto tracks because train AI is even worse than car AI. Cargo stations are too slow to handle the traffic they have to suck up even in a small industrial area. And there are no bigger train stations. Mods provide these, but the AI doesn\\'t have the ability to choose empty platforms so you have stations with 4 tracks, but only one is used. And there is nothing you can do about that.\\nSo you try to fix the problem again by better track design. An important information for this would be the length of trains because you can\\'t set stop signs and your trains constantly clog up crossings. But that\\'s no info you can get. So it\\'s trial and error. Which is driving you nuts after 5 minutes because - last point - the game engine\\'s limitations. I swear to god: If I have to read \"slope too steep\" or \"tile blocked\" one more time I\\'ll throw my PC out of the window. Example: you build a one way track but then decide it would be better if it went the other direction. 50% chance you can\\'t inverse the already built road because \"blocked by other object\" or suddenly the \"slope is too steep\". So you delete the segment that\\'s blocking your way which suddenly changes the terrain around it that was adapted to the road you had previously built. But now you can\\'t build that part again because both ends have adifferent height now and guess what: \"Slope is too steep\" and the buildings next to it - which were perfectly fine 5 seconds ago - now block you path. And this is mid- to lategame. ALL. THE. TIME. \\nAnd this is why - with a heavy heart -  I have to say: Don\\'t buy this game. \\n\\n',\n",

It took me some convincing before I would buy a game worth that much. After I've watched/read various reviews of the game, which were all positive, I finally decided that I'd buy the game, and I'm happy with the decision. As of posting this review I only have about 2 hours played, but I can tell already that I'm going to love this game and probably play many more hours. There are so many features in this game, from big things like creating individual districts that have their own policies, to small things like renaming the residents of your city.\\n\\nThe only visible flaw of this game to me, is the game's font. It's so small on my screen that it is almost unreadable. This problem is being experienced by many other players of the game aswell. As of now, that is my only problem with the game and I hope that it'll be fixed soon.\\n\\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the City Builder genre.

       "  'review': \"Love this game so much. It's so relaxing to play that I use it to calm down sometimes when I'm stressed out. I think the expansions have added a lot of depth to the game but if I'm honest the reason that this game has been so successful is because CO have completely embraced the modding community. There are so many amazing mods out there that really improve the quality of the game (such as traffic manager), meaning that you can really go as indepth into creating your city as you'd like. It is more of a traffic management sim than a city management, but to be honest I'm obsessed with roads and I can spend hours just building a single junction on the game. I like building cities knowing in advance that certain junctions are going to become too busy, and then setting myself challenges to fix it without knocking down anything, as would be the case in real life.\\n\\nAll in all, I would really recommend this to anyone who enjoys Simcity or other city building games, especially if you love traffic simulation.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought this game on Xbox with all the DLC and loved it so much that as soon as I upgraded my PC to something more modern, I bought this game for PC and almost all the DLC. So I used to be a wholehearted supporter of the people who made this game. But recently (5 years after the game was released) they forced a new launcher on us and said we have to agree to having our data collected and sold to companies not associated with this game at all (like facebook and google to name a couple). If we don't agree to the new EULA we can't play the game which we already paid for. There is no option to opt-out, no option to roll back to a previous version of the game before the launcher was added, and no consideration for the legality of forcefully installing software onto my computer that collects data and sends it somewhere else. And when a lot of people complained, the public face for the company, Azure, lied and said it was only about 40 people posting over and over and most people were happy with it. Looking at the recent reviews on the store page says that's not true. And there is also a suspicious rise in the number of positive reviews to counter the hundreds of negative reviews they are getting. So Paradox and Colossal Order are engaging in some highly shady business practices that I want no part in. I recommend nobody to buy any products from them in the future.\",\n",

Despite mods being abundant, the developers locked borderline essentials behind DLC. Parklife and Game Day come to the top of my head as egregious examples. It's up to $200 for the bundle with all current DLC. As far as I am concerned, if the DLC costs twice as much as the base game, it's time for a new game. No one likes throwing money at software from 2016.\\n\\nAdding in the launcher is an obvious issue that others have covered better than I could. There are now more intriguing options by smaller developers that are better priced, take advantage of newer hardware, and do not rely on predatory DLC. I do not recommend paying full-price for this game in 2021.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I was always interested in city building games, even if only on the level of mapping the streets and zoning.\\n\\nAfter the infamous flop of SimCity 2013, Cities Skylines just appeared out of the blue to take over most of the internet, as one of the most comprehensive and high quality modern city simulators around.\\n\\nThanks to the After Dark update, the game looks positively gorgeous. Sure, the models and textures are quite poor up close, but the game wasn\\'t designed to be viewed from a pedestrian\\'s perspective, despite the (admittedly awesome) first person mods. But simply looking towards the horizon, above your city, it\\'s magical.\\n\\nThe music is cheerful - repetitive a bit, but cheerful and fits the bustling city atmosphere. Chirper starts off as a nice way to learn from your citizens how your city\\'s faring, then becomes grating with the same tweets being given off about cats rescued by fire detectors, or how nice a place the city is. The rest of the sounds nail the busy metropolis theme.\\n\\nGameplay is stellar, and very, very strategic. You lay down roads of various widths, then zone out areas for either residential, commercial or industrial buildings. Put down a coal plant, or several wind turbines, and deliver power to the masses. Set up the water pumping station and the sewage dumps - but be careful not to leave sewage upstream of the pumping station. Lay down services, such as medical clinics, fire stations, police stations, landfills and so on, and make sure they get as much coverage as possible. Create leisure zones, parks and other attractions, reduce noise and pollution, and allow for decent public services, to improve land value and level up buildings. Expand as your city does.\\n\\nThe degree of simulation is such that you can follow individual \"cims\" walking out of their house, to their car, driving through junctions (and maybe getting caught in the infamous jams), reach their workplace or education facility, spend some time there, then return home. Every single citizen has a little schedule to follow. The water, which you can channel through a dam to power your city, is fully simulated, and badly placed dams and waterfront protection can cause flooding, which is not exactly good for your city. Traffic is the player\\'s biggest threat - if you don\\'t plan way, way ahead what you\\'re doing, you are going to grind your city to a halt.\\n\\nThe modding community is fantastic, providing addons ranging from highway interchanges and junction types, to new buildings, to enhanced AI logic, simulation, traffic actions and so on.\\n\\nIt is a huge rush wildly flailing in panic at the sight of multiple problems occuring across the city, almost entirely due to poor traffic flow, and so is the relief that comes after successfully dealing with said situation.\\n\\nI really like this game. You ought to play it.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Probably the best city sim on Steam that I've tried, but that comes with a lot of caveats.  Expensive but sometimes useful DLC packs (none of which are worth it at full price IMO), game logic that is so deep and different that it sometimes feels like learning a new language, and hiding almost all of your useful structures/resources behind a scaling set of milestones that is set off of your citizen count.  \\n\\nIf you weren't turned off by all that, this game is very relaxing to watch (once you're past the initial half hr), has a HUGE selection of assets/mods in the workshop, and is extremely pleasing to the eyes both graphically and in watching all your different systems in action.  I'll mention this yet again - I found that a lot of the systems like public transportation were extremely difficult to gain even a basic grasp of without watching videos.  Highly recommended, but plan on losing hours just learning the game on Youtube, and even more hours losing yourself in the game :)\",\n",

Excellent  game, so extensive and deep gameplay. Will probably get the DLC for it quite soon :)\\n\\ni just took a break cuz i killed my own city after trying to change all my industial zones for offices (for the achievement) and somehow i cut off my entire city (160k ppl) from the power which was a point of no return.\\nIt was then i realised i didnt have autosave on or that the last manual save i did was this morning.\\n\\nI'm not even mad, it just means i can restart all over again without the noob mistakes (or well, less of 'em)\\n\\n10/10 would kill entire city for achievement again.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"First of all, I had very high expectations, and that's never a good thing. Secondly, I played SimCity 4: Rush Hour until today.\\nNow I don't have to, because I have Cities: Skylines, which is truly a successor of it.\\n\\nPROs:\\n- Road-engineering is really next-gen!\\n- The graphics/physics are not just good, but feature cool/cute details too (for example, when a truck ramps on a highway, it bounces a bit)\\n- I love the water/wind simulation (besides it is just a very small part of the game)\\n- People-based simulation is fascinating, and even over 40.000 population the game runs perfectly\\n- The different map layers look good, and are useful \\n- The game is almost bug-free on day one! (Hello EA, I am waving at you)\\n- Map size is small at the beginning, but can be expanded later, at the end is somewhat the same size as the 4x4 in SimCity 4, which is huge (EA? Are you still here?)\\n- Mod and custom asset support!\\n\\nCONs:\\n- It is hard and easy at the same time. Let me explain: to make a perfect traffic in a big city is almost impossible, if you don't want to destroy everything and make your city a big highway intersection (which I am not a fan of). On the other hand, keeping everything in terrible traffic have no consequences at all! I think this is bad, because the game doesn't reward you if you make a good traffic. I have just watched a stream when a guy used only dirty roads in his city over 40.000 pop, and the city worked perfectly. In SimCity 4, when you do this, people moves out of their homes, because the commute time is so high, and so the offices/commercial/industry will fall too. I really hope they will fix this.\\n- The public transportation has some issues too. According to my experiences, only buses can be operated profitable. Also, train traffic is ridiculous: even a metropolis should have less train-traffic, and most of them operate nearly empty (10/240 passengers or so).\\n- I am not a big fan of working cities with only skyscapers. In SimCity 4, when you zone high density residential, but people feel they don't want to live in a mega-block, they will build some low-dense housing instead. Like in a normal city. Here, you zone high-everything, and they just build a Manhattan in the middle of nothing. \\n\\nBut overall this is a great game, and I highly recommend it! Also, I am quite sure they will fix all the bugs and consider changing some of the cons I mentioned. Happy gaming!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve put 160 hours into this game. My max population I ever got to was over 70,000. Ive done it a couple of times, but i always restart because i\\'m trying to discover a solution to a HUGE problem in this game.\\n\\nThe problem is traffic. The AI in this game are programmed horribly. They will always take the shortest route to their destination. Instead, they need to be programmed to take the fastest route to their destination.\\n\\nFor example, lets say most of the AI turn right at a certain intersection. I put a 3 lane road there so that they can have two right turns. (I need to add here that there is no function in the game that allows you to specify which lane goes where. You have to install a mod for that).  I allow the AI to use the first and second lanes for right turns. 99% of the cars will use the first lane & 1% of the cars will use the second lane. This is because they are programmed to take the shortest route to their destination. Because of this, you will have 100 cars in one of the lanes and 1 car in the other lane. This is illogical. Instead, they need to program the AI to go for the FASTEST route.\\n\\nHere\\'s another example. You have a three lane road that eventually hits an intersection. Going straight at the intersection takes the AI cars to a suburb area but turning right takes the AI to the shops. 99% of the AI will be turning right, so they will all drive in the far right lane even if they are 50 miles away from the intersection. locigal humans don\\'t do this, so it creates traffic problems you wouldn\\'t realistically have in a simulation.\\n\\nA final problem i\\'ve found with this game is the death waves. You have to be careful to allow building of houses 1 little plot at a time. If you allow the development  of a huge plot of land, for example, all the AI will move in at the same time. Then, they will NEVER MOVE OUT until they die. I think someone estimated each AI has a life span of like 18 years, so after 18 years in game time, suddenly the whole neighborhood will die of old age. You will experience what the community calls \"Death waves\\' and it will make the game painful once your population gets to be about 40,000.\\n\\nThese two things are game breaking in my opinion.',\n",

       "  'review': \"In my opinion, this picks up the torch from Simcity 4. It is an actual city building game (which doesn't require an internet connection btw) that has pretty much everything I liked about the older games in it, but it also adds in a few fresh mechanics that keep things interesting. The traffic patterning, the modeling of pollution, and the electrical grid I find to be vast improvements over older games mechanically, and I love the water effects as well(I spent a good 5 minutes watching a dam fill up. It was mesmerizing) The only thing that I can gripe about if I get really nitpicky is that you have to plan transit routes and I would like more transport options. However, those could be easily rectified with a mod similar to NAM for simcity 4, and this game is designed to be easily moddable. Other than that, it's a very stable game which isn't terribly resource intensive for your PC. 10/10 would inadvertantly flood the highway leading into town with a dam again.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Enjoy the worst english possible.\\n\\nAfter 800+ hrs in the game this is my review:\\n\\nPros\\n-Best and most detailed Citybuilder to date\\n-Graphics\\n-Mods\\n-and a lot more\\n\\nCons\\n-Management is a bit too easy\\n-Limitations in the PC versions probably due to streamlining between PC and consoleversions\\n-Paradox style DLC´s\\n\\nNeutral\\n-HARDWAREHUNGRY (dont use 100 mods and 1000 assets if your using a better toaster)\\n- Restricted acces to mods in Offline mode (Steams fault, they f***ed it up years ago and never fixed their weird workshop... so no negative point here, Colossal Order or Paradox cant do s*** if steam screwes up)\\n\\nCities Skylines...  is awesome. \\nIf you are looking for a Citybuilder wich focusses more on BUILDING your City.\\nIts detailed like no builder before, you will spend hours decorating your town, plazas transitstations and so on...\\n\\nWhen you are looking for a MANAGEMENT- Game this falls a bit flat.\\nThe management focus here is all about traffic. \\nPublic needs and politics are on a pretty basic level and after a few hours you will have no problems with money. Citizens are also so easy to please, it could be a bit more detailed with different Political partys and public uprising, sadly most mechanics wich go in this direction are so basic...  After like 100 hrs i didnt give a s*** about pollution or anything like this anymore.\\n\\nI would generally reccomand turning off money and activating all buildings from the beginning in \"Sandbox mode\" and just use Money and the unlock mechanic for the Scenarios, it don´t matter and after the first 1-2 hours on a map money is pretty much just a timer. Its nearly impossible to get into debts and is just a limitation to BIG building project.\\n\\nIt seems like this is one of the most common reasons to give this a downvote so i´ll talk about Mods here:\\nYes many mods seem nessesearly and i would loose my interesst in Cities pretty fast without Anarchy mods, more beautification and manymanymany more. BUT instead calling the devs \"idiots\" cause they cant implement what others already done, im sure this comes down to One reason: \\n\\nHARDWARE\\n\\nWith the ~60 mods (and ~2000 Assets) i use, my RAM usage is at 20+ GB without Stuff like Loadscreenmanager it would be at 25+GB.\\nThe \"Casual PC\" still uses 8-16 GB RAM and including all this nice stuff like Trafficmanager`s alternate AI ,turning off vehicle limit and so on would make the game unplayable for manymany ppl.\\n\\nAlso there are the  Consoleversions, the current consoles (x-one ps4 switch in all their versions) were outdated the moment they got announced (for someone with a Gaming PC) and now years later they are just scrapmetal. A friend of my plays this on his X-box One Elite (ofc without mods) and its soooo Laggy...  Dunno what to say here...  Maybe f*** Consoles?\\n\\nThe 2. most usuall reason to dislike are the DLC´s, and THIS is a Point i can kinda understand (to certain extend).\\nThere are 3 Types of DLC´s in cities:\\n-The \"Big\" ones like Industries or Greencities wich add Mechanics, Buildings and so on. ~10-15 bucks\\n-Content creator packs, wich are made by modders and add some District styles. ~5-7 bucks\\n-And Radio stations. ~2-5 bucks\\n\\nSo with the basegame beeing priced at 27,99 € wich is half of a so called \"AAA Fullprice title\" i cant see this beeing a cashgrab :)\\n\\nWhile i would absolutly reccomand getting the Big ones, the Content packs and Radiostations are something about personal taste.\\nFor example i got all Big but only 2 content packs and NO Radio station.\\n\\nRadio in generall is pretty cool, commercials for shops in your town or just some talking between songs adds to the atmosphere. Sadly most stations contain this \"Generic Student music\" think its called \"Lo-fi\" and thats just not my type of music, Gold FM and Jazzstation are the only ones matching my taste so i keep waiting for a Pinkfloyd/Cash/Hendrix station (or keep creating my own stations).\\n\\nThe Content creator packs are made by dudes and dudines known to the community since years like Avanya and im using sooo many additional mods from this guys, i feel ok if they get some attention and cash.\\n\\nThe Big DLC´s are for the most part worth the money, or lets say ALL are worth the money. I just think at this point they should include some of them into the basegame like After Dark or Mass Transit or lower the price of this \"old\" DLC´s. Most Seller will already give you the basegame and 2-3 DLC´s for the money Steam charges you for the basegame but...  Steam is Steam is Steam.\\n\\nSo if you are the dude that wants to build a woodchopper and a mine to make tools to upgrade his houses, just to unlock the next generic production line (like for example in Anno) this is the wrong game, if you want to spend hundreds of hours fixing your traffic or modeling your trainstations.... go get it!!!\\n\\nSmall note at the end: Somewhen back... 2016? 17?  Steam changed lots of stuff at the Workshop and made it pretty much impossible to use mods with dependancys to other mods in offline mode. While using assets and props is no problem (as soon as you Copy paste them out of steams Mod folder and into the games own, some Mods cant find their dependancys as soon as you change the directorys (yeah sounds logic). Since they changed this Steam is \"investigating\" what casues the problem... So at this point since 3-4 years...  Talked to the Cities devs a few times about this and they cant do anything about it, all they could do is posting their request to Steam in the official forums.\\n\\nEdit 2022\\n\\nSince a while the DLC spam went overboard.\\nThe last three \"Big\" DLCs: Plazas, Sunset and Airports are sadly just lazy reskinns of Parklife and simply dont integrate as well into the game as Industrys (Also a Parklife reskin tbh)\\n\\nWhile the industry DLC is something you will use on every map, multiple times while building different types of specialized zones during different \"stages\" of your town development the airports... well you usually build only one... and this not even on every map.\\nP&P is actually something I (and many others for that matter) been waiting for a long while, sadly its really REALLY lacking content. There are so few building options for Zonables... its just terrible to look at. Without massive use of Workshop assets this is a no go.\\nAnd Sunset... is basicly a mini dlc for the industry dlc with the fishing industry, and offers barely any content worth the money. \\nTrollybus is a bus/tram hybrid with noone of their strenghts but all their weaknesses in one, and the few Holiday/harbor assets... pfff...\\n\\nAnd worse... both Airports and P&P been released in a terrible buggy state. Even now months after Airport release the Plane AI is still a total mess, both on ground aswell as in the Air, while P&P still suffers from multiple issues with pathfinding.\\nThe amount of content and worse the REPLAYABILITY of the last DLCs is a joke compared to the old ones.\\nAgain you will use industry DLC zones all the time, in every game, multiple times...\\nParklife? Heck since parklife i barely ever use \"generic\" parks and instead use Parklife all the way... using this DLC content on every map a few dozend of times....\\nTo be fair, not every \"Old\" dlc is well done, campus or after dark aint that great either.\\nBut neither been they released as Buggy nor been they this empty or disconnected from the game.\\n\\nAlso\\nHardware\\nThis was a huge part in my original review and i had a lot of understanding for the high demand... \\nBut right now its become pretty depressing.\\nA regular Basegame map + all big DLC + 4 Content creator packs + 3 Districy style DLCs and\\nIm now at ~24gb ram usage\\nUsing no Mods at all\\n\\nMy current modded decorative town im playing? \\n64/64GB ram usage.... 256GB Pagefile\\nand this is using Load-screen-manager + Load-Order-Tool wich both improve the Ram usage for example by merging identical textures (something the basegame dont lmao).\\nAnd seriously i dont plan to upgrade to 128 GB ram for Cities only....\\n\\nWe need less DLC spam and more Polishment right now...',\n",

       "  'review': \"BEST CITY MANAGEMENT GAME!\\n(Economically Educational and Helpful)\\n\\nI really like to play Management Games especially City Management Games. As a matter of fact, I even joined Facebook just to play CityVille. Unfortunately, it was already shut down. Since then, I never was able to play city management games again due to my student responsibilities.\\n\\nI just started Steam 3 months ago because of peer pressure and curiosity. I was wondering why teens are into gaming more specifically DOTA and CS:GO which were really popular in all computer shops here in the Philippines. I was not a big fan of it though and I am afraid that I might get addicted to it and that I may not have time for my academics and extra-curricular activities.\\n\\nThen everything changed when I scrolled the Steam Store. I saw this game, Cities:Skylines, and it sparked my interest. I never knew Steam would have games that are economically educational and helpful. I then started playing this game and WOW, I was just so amazed. I imagined it to be like CityVille or other mobile City Management game but it is more than what I have imagined. It is not just about putting Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Services to make a city but you need to be concerned on traffic management, public transportation, healthcare, education, citizens' safety, water supply, waste deposits, electric supply, and many more. I then started to play with the DLC's and I was astonished. It made the game better and complex which I really love the most. I was really satisfied on the game and I learned a lot of economical behaviors just by playing it. \\n\\nIn the end, I got addicted to it LOL! It may have lessen my sleeping period but atleast I am having fun, right? and besides it is economically educational. It was one of the reasons why I chose ABM for Senior High School. I am very thankful to Cities:Skylines and Steam for entering my life.\\n\\nI really recommend this game to everyone!\\nHoping to see more helpful DLC's soon!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I'm going to be brutally honest here..\\n\\nI never understood the praise for this game developer/publisher. I love this game; it’s a little bit more flexible than most city builders out there. But, Its dumb how overpriced the DLC content is and how little it brings to the game. From the release of this game I’ve seen constant praise for (not really so much the game) the developer of Cities Skyline, I have to wonder what's going on? If a company like EA did something like this to their game (which they have) people would be screaming bloody murder.\\n\\nTo be honest I kinda get it, good developers are hard to come by. But a company that gives you one new building for $15 is not a good company. That’s a company that is trying to imitate the most hated company in America, EA. \\n\\nNow don't get me wrong, the game is incredibly fun, but with all the overpriced DLC the game has out right now if you refuse to buy any of it like me, you will end up missing out on a lot of important game changing features. They need to combine all the DLC they have, and release it with a 10-15 dollar price tag. The game is not worth all the money you need to put into it for so little content. That's why I can't recommend it right now.\\n\\nIt's funny to me how the new Sim City did this and died a horrible death. But only recently have people started to catch on to this developer and see just how much they are milking their EXTREMELY loyal fan base. I hate to see it. I hope they correct the situation soon.\",\n",

So I won\\'t rehash that.\\n\\n[h1]What I like about Cities: Skylines[/h1]\\n[olist]\\n    [*]It\\'s relaxed\\n    [*]There are a huge number of community content additions to the game\\n    [*]Roads, zoning, sevices etc are all easy to apply (there is a learning curve)\\n    [*]Since I\\'ve owned the game, there have still been official updates & content additions\\n    [*]June 2016 saw a small free DLC pack\\n    [*]Expansion of territory is simple\\n    [*]Apart from the stock unlimited money mod, you can get a first person one too, allowing you to wander about\\n    [*]You can rename anything. Everything has default names, but you can rename people, dogs, areas, housing etc\\n[/olist]\\n\\n[h1]What I don\\'t like about Cities: Skylines[/h1]\\nI have tried to think of counter points to the above, something negative, but I can\\'t really name any. There are a few missteps I made in my first few games - such as planning / designing areas in a tightly aranged format, preventing easy upgrades to roads. But that\\'s part of the learning curve I mentioned above. There\\'s really been nothing bad about the game at all. There has been one oddity / amusing gaff: a road twisting when elevated, cornering too tightly, and positioned too close to last point - but that\\'s the only thing.\\n\\nOne thing I would like to suggest to the devs, is to make the single-instance trees to have more of an effect (an effect?) on noise pollution.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay Note:[/b] You may be tempted to build all up on your high way access. Don\\'t. You will rue the day you did that. Think space. You don\\'t need to cram things in.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I just keep coming back to Cities Skylines as the base city builder. Sim City is nowhere near this quality, Maxis is dead, long live Colossal Order. \\n\\nThe best thing about Cities Skylines: mod support. The sheer amount of fantastic mods and assets out there is amazing. There are mods to support mods; just sayin'. Dev teams just cannot produce the dedication of enthusiasts due to the monetization and required quality control: mod support was the best outcome here. And there are some fantastic people out there creating awesome assets and mods. I can spend hours watching the fascinating traffic if you change the chaos with TMPE or try to build a good looking waste management facility. \\n\\nThe worst thing about Cities Skylines: it's a Paradox game. That means your data is for grabs, you get a useless launcher so they can grab even more data to sell and you get their standard DLC treatment. But luckily the game itself is very much enjoyable, and the DLCs also add nice stuff. Some are much better than others of course, but I've seen much worse on Paradox games (Prison Architect used to be my favorite - until the added DLCs broke most of the base game) so I'll tip my fedora to CO for their quality DLC builds. \\n\\nIf you love city builders and you don't have Cities Skylines yet, shame on you (seriously, it's 7 years old now). If you are thinking about trying a city builder, this one definitely tops the list. If you have issues with the price, just wait for a sale here on Steam or on Humble Bundle.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It's very hard to keep a good city with enough money to buy all the services, but as you play more, you start getting the mechanics. Youtube videos have helped me a lot, to be honest. When I first started, the game was just giving me more and more and more information that I was not able to keep up with everything and felt overwhelmed. However, I've watch couple of videos that have really helped to how to start a city on ''the right foot'' and I've pretty much made improvements but I'm obviously still lacking a lot. \\n\\nYou gotta be responsible of the income, taxes and all the money that you spent, making sure every cent you spent is worth it so you don't waste more than needed. As the city grows, there is more demand, which personally makes me anxious and nervous *laughs* but it's really fun because you end up spending more than 1 hour (in my case, 2 hours even)  trying to figure out ways to grow the city and then you look at the time and you get surprised because you've been playing a lot without even realising because of how good this game entertains you.\\n\\nIf you have enough patience (which I don't have, but still, it's manageable) and very creative and learn quickly about the structure of the game, you'll easily catch up with this and I can assure you, you'll enjoy it in the end. The cons is that if you are like me, you can get very overwhelmed and anxious when there is lots of demand.\\n\\nI'm still trying to grow my big city, it's hard but I get the help from videos since I don't think you can learn just by yourself in this game. I hope I will achieve the last milestone and be proud of my own city. I like this game.\",\n",

I was really sad that Maxis seemed to have lost it's collective mind with their genre-defining city builder but that's another story.\\n\\nThis a lot of fun to play. Interestingly, I have seen news stories about my local government city planning that INCLUDED demonstrations using this game. I don't know if they just used a modded consumer version of this game or the studio releases a version for actual city planners but they definitely use this game for actual city planning.\\n\\nThat said the game is really good. The right mods only make it amazing.\\n\\nSEVERAL points off for making it really, really dry, however. The lack of humanity or personality in the form of questing and city dweller and government interaction makes this feel like I'm just building a model and not an actual city with little actual sims with wants, needs and feelings. Secret: name a street Steve. I think the game could expand much in this way in the form of tasks and quests. \\n\\nReplayability is maximum level on this game. Much like Maxis' The Sims, this is less a game and more a toy. And like most toys, one gets tired of it but, if it's a good toy, we come back to play it over and over again.\",\n",

The mods. The supports. The game itself. My tears has been wiped dry. For SGD55 it has given me countless hours in trying to replicate a seamless city. 378 hours and still counting. Truly amazing. With that said, the king \"SimCity\" has ben dethroned. This is the new king! The new benchmark in city simulation. The new yardstick!!! \\n\\nPs - I\\'ve read some negative reviews about this game. No doubt there are some bugs and issues that need sorted out by the devs. No game is perfect. Give it time and it will be the best city builder game by far. Another major complain was that this game focus is more towards modding. As a city builder game you want variety of buildings, roadways, vehicle and etc. And that is where the modding community shines. It adds flavour to the game. I\\'m sure you will get bored of the plain \\'ol vanilla building made by the devs sooner or later. And when i scrolled through the bad reviews something caught my attention. I\\'d say 80% of them have raked up on average of 30 hours on the game. That\\'s just not fair. Each to their own then.\\n\\n27th November 2018 - 2300+ hours on this game.

I remember playing Sims City 4 Deluxe Edition and thinking of how good it was, this game may have surpassed it's greatness. This game released a little over two years after the disaster that was Sims City 5. Picture everything wrong with that game, then think of the exact opposite and you have Cities: Skylines.    \\n\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n- Very good graphics.\\n- The little details (building signs, people biking, store fronts, etc).\\n- Few repetitive buildings in close proximity, looks more realistic. \\n- The traffic system (yes, it has some positives but I'll address the negatives in the cons below).\\n- Day/Night cycle, it almost seems to change the whole look of your city. \\n- Well optimized. \\n- Frequent updates and patches. \\n- Water physics. \\n\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n- Traffic will stay in one lane even if it is a 6 lane highway. What is the point of having different road types if your citizens use one lane? It is not a deal breaker for this game, but it does pull you out of the fantastic city environment Paradox Interactive worked so hard to make. \\n- Maybe 2-3 crashes within my small time played. It's not really an issue but I thought I would list it.  \\n\\n[b]My Verdict:[/b] 7/10 (If the issues with the traffic are fixed it is easily a 8/10)\",\n",

The Graphics are quite good and even large cities run without to much slowdown (my largest City gave me about 15-20 fps less then a new one). The only complaint i am having is that my city is always dying as soon as i look away from my monitor for longer then 3 seconds. But thats probably my Fault so if you are up to the Challenge of buying a new Beautiful ciy which can actually reach the size of a real Metropolis (I am loooking at you Sim City) This game is definetly worth its money.',\n",

I like to see my cities grow from little hamlets to big cities with over 75k people.\\nII) I can be creative. There are so many mods and so many roads and style of playing and it is so cool.\\nIII) It's (somewhat) realistic with the base game. In vanilla (no mods), the graphics look amazing, especially for an indie game. Bravo paradox!\\nIV) New patches. This game has been patched and fixed and it makes the game less buggy in general.\\nV) The price is cheap. With one steam card ($20), you can purchase this game, which makes it cheap for what it allows you to do. (P.S. this game is 1/3 the price of SimCity 2013(?).)\\n\\nCons:\\nI) It makes my PC lag a little. I have a pretty mid ranged computer with no graphics card, and It runs okay. It gets choppy though, and I have to turn the graphics down.\\nII) DLC. There are a lot of features locked behind DLC, but its still worth it. (Pro/Con. Depens on how you see this.)\\n\\nOverall, this gets 4.5/5. I just need a graphics card and some money, and then its a 5/5\\nGraphics (no mods): 4/5\\nGameplay: 5/5\\nPerformance: 3/5\\nUI: 4.5/5\\nDifficulty: Easy\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Much as I prefer to let each game stand on its own, certain games demand comparisons. In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity – not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade – a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your heart’s content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative.\\n\\nPlaying as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens’ dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff that’s been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as they’re laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldn’t have a city-builder without them - so it’s mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that.\\n\\nThe first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence I’m sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there’s plenty of room. And while you can’t directly edit terrain while you play, there’s an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support.\\n\\nWith such large cities, it’s fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a map’s natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district.\\n\\nLet’s zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds – three and a half on the fastest – which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesn’t seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in.\\n\\nMaking a major city’s traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I haven’t come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but there’s a sandbox mode that’ll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (There’s also an unlimited money mode.)\\n\\nMass transit is a tricky beast. It’s not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. It’s easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and it’s frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it.\\n\\nUp close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCity’s attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesn’t match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they don’t quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same.\\n\\nWhat Skylines isn’t good at is telling you what you’ve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didn’t want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I don’t know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I don’t understand why.\\n\\nIn that light, it’s fortunate that it’s fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump – basically piping raw sewage into your citizens’ tap water – or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000.\\n\\nIt’s limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those don’t spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I don’t mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement that’s been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning.\\n\\nMore than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the simple joy of building. It’s a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens’ apparent concerns. Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder.',\n",

I don\\'t get why people are getting upset and selecting \"not recommended\" just because of that. You can buy them, if you want Night Activities, Snow, Disasters, Mass Transit, Stadiums, Concerts or roof-gardens. But you don\\'t have to. I lived fine without any DLCs and later with just Mass Transit. And if you want to, you can get everything from Mass Transit, well, except Blimps, by using mods.\\n\\n[b]For example:[/b]\\nMonorail? Use \"Metro Overhaul Mod\"\\nFerries? Use some mod I forgot the name of... Sorry\\nTwo/Four Lane Hwys & National Rd? Use \"Network Extensions Project\"\\n\\nIn my opinion, it\\'s a great game and completely worth the $30. And I completely agree with LGR that \"[i]You get twice the game [compared to SimCity 2013] at half the cost [SC2013, $60 at launch][/i]\" and \"[i]If it wasn\\'t as good as it is we would be calling it a ripoff [of SimCity 2013].

With the support of mods, it gives you dozens of possibilities to unleash your creativity, whether you are just starting out or are into detailing your dream community. \\n\\nMods support is essential in this game, as they handle most of the issues that are not addressed by the game developers themselves, such as better traffic management or public transport configuration. Without the mods, the game is still fun, but with them it is spectacular. \\n\\nThe amount of mods and other stuff it has to load for the city to work requires a good PC, and most of the time a good few minutes for the game to load. Not to mention troubleshooting, should something go nuts... But, should there be no recent game update and the mods are all OK, it is a great game.\\n\\nSadly, the developers are not so great. DLCs are a big way to milk money out of the players. They are usually required to run selected things, and also the whole game collapses for a few weeks as a free update usually damages all the mods. Not to mention whole cities were damaged due to the discontinuation of some mods...\\n\\nI would definitely buy the game - however, look for a bundle such as Humble Bundle, in order not to pay a huge load of money for DLCs. The successor to this game should be in the making a few years ago, with all the player-made resources added.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Best city simulator hands down. I must admit that it is more of a traffic management simulator rather than an all around city simulator, espically challenge wise, but you have to take what you can get. Terrible traffic AI is the only thing that makes you think about suicide now and then. Other than that a perfect game in all aspects for me. Mods makes it even better. Dlcs may become kind of a cashgrab so waiting a sale might be the better option. Definitely recommend 9.5/10.\\n\\nMoreover, I want to ask Colossal Order to increase or wholly abondon car/cim limit in their next game. Very few of the active gamers use a patato rig with a celeron and 2gb ram nowadays. Make it 64 bit only and give us freedom. Also fix the damn traffic AI. Sadly, mods are not enough to educate brainless drivers. Thanks for the game and your effort!',\n",

Your cities have no history, no focus unless you impose one artificially (and even then it's more aesthetic than functional), no life (it's depressingly easy to bulldoze whole districts - the citizens who lived there relocate without a squeak), no charm.

       "  'review': 'Did you play SimCity and you were disappointed by how fast the gameplay seemed to stall out? Did you not play city sims before, and you are looking for a good place to start? Either way this game is a brilliant choice for you. The content offering it provides is abselutely insane. Compared to the already mentioned SimCity, I would say you get 5x the game for 1/3 the price. After 450 hours of gameplay, I have never \"finished\" any city to the point where I could not expand any further. To top it all off, basically any annoying gameplay issue you encounter can be solved in 5 minutes of browsing the workshop. \\n\\nI will now get picky and point out the biggest weaknesses I have found during my hundreds of hours of playtime, but keep in mind that I would never play the game that much if I did not love it in it\\'s current state. \\n[olist]\\n    [*]The DLC is not worth it. The DLC almost costs half of the game itself, and adds very little to the gameplay. After Dark mostly makes it very annoying to build half of the time, because it is, you know... dark at night. Apart from that the gameplay around the day/night cycle is not that appealing, to me at least. Snowfall would be worth if there was a season cycle, but you either have permanent snow, or no snow at all.\\n    [*]Some mods are almost mandatory. I don\\'t consider this a big issue, but I know nothing about the performance implications of mods on low end machines. The game is totally playable without mods, I actually had every steam achievement available before DLC, so I have enjoyed quite some hours with no mods. It is just that when you first start modding, it\\'s really hard to go back(this is why I don\\'t have any of the DLC achievements, lol).\\n    [*]Some costs seem very unbalanced. In the \"standard game\" I often found myself splitting my budget 50/50. Between garbage plus death services, and everything else... Why is as expensive to burn your garbage as it is to upkeep all your hospitals, fire stations, and police stations combined? These things are really easy to mod on your own though, so again, it\\'s not a game breaking issue. \\n[/olist]\\n\\nIf you think you might enjoy the game a quarter as much as I do, it\\'s probably your best buy you ever made.',\n",

       "  'review': 'It\\'s like someone finally decided to make a worthy successor to SimCity 4.\\n\\n\"But Coprolite,\" you say, \"They made a sequel to...\"\\n\\nIt\\'s like someone finally decided to make a worthy successor to SimCity 4, jumping off from that point and developing greater complexity while expanding in scope.  It\\'s a far cry at this point from the early city builders. This game can be almost daunting to get into, and it can be oh so easy to have everything bog down in gridlock. I\\'ve lost count of how many cities I started and threw away because my initial foundations just didn\\'t work. A wealth of expansions and an uncountable horde of mods only adds to this complexity.\\n\\nBut with this complexity comes an experience that you can lose yourself in with tinkering. Tinkering with road networks. Tinkering with bus routes. Tinkering with the latest neighbourhood. Speaking of which, you can actually have those, breaking your city up into regions which you can apply different policies to or different design aesthetics. Your city can evolve into a complex patchwork of specialisations and characters. Like I just spent hours building a lovely transit-oriented development with a park and trail network at its core.\\n\\nAnd this is a game that has been growing, evolving, constantly adding functionality.\\n\\nFair warning: this game can be a bit of a beast, especially as your cities get larger. Still, I built my PC in 2014 on an i5 processor with 16GB of RAM, which I threw a new graphics card into last year. It\\'s not exactly a powerhouse, but it can still manage some pretty sizeable cities.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Excellent city building game. Very addictive, reasonably priced and has mod support. Can't wait to see what kind of stuff people come up with.\\nThere isn't much in terms of a tutorials, but the user interface is pretty easy to get to grips with.  \\n\\nIt's the sort of game where you learn from your mistakes. I must have started about 5 or so cities before I figured out how to even get the ball rolling, but once you do, it's incredibly compelling.\\nI am on my first city at the moment, and although it is proving profitable, the way I laid out the roads is pretty random and has been causing traffic problems.\\n\\nAlso, I started drawing in a totally random bus route, adding stops all over the place and now it is telling me that I haven't completed the loop for my insane bus route and I can't figure out how to complete it for the life of me...or erase it. haha\\n\\nIt seems pretty bug free, and it is very well optimised. Been playing it on my GT650m laptop and it is running great at 1080p on high settings. It's a very entertaining time sink. You can easily lose hours just evolving and maintaining your city.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[Disclosure: This was reviewed due to a review copy provided by Paradox]\\n\\nAfter 2013’s debacle that was Sim City it was time some new devs stepped to the table. Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!\\n\\nCities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.\\n\\nWhen you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.\\n\\nAlong with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.\\n\\nThat being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.\\n\\nOne other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for  “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.\\n\\nNow this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.\\n\\nThe sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.\\n\\nOverall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.  This is a must in my opinion for anyone that was looking for the next good city builder especially those that like to play in offline mode.\\n\\nReview with screenshots: http://fg-2.com/2015/03/10/review-cities-skylines/',\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities Skylines can be reightfully be considered the successor to Sim City 4 from 2003. With the game tasking the player into the development of a city with a variety of tools at their disposal. I would first like to commend the developers for allowing a player to micromanage areas of their city to create stunning areas all created by hand. Along with the game presenting dynamic traffic systems. Something unheard of by their predecessors. By forcing the player to  deal with traffic, police, fire and medicinal issues as units in the map area of effects of games such as Sim City 3000. \\n\\nIf you are a fan of dynamic city builders. Then Cities Skylines is a game you must tried as it raised the bar in the city builder genre.',\n",

You can't literally do whatever you want but you would be hard-pressed to come up against any challenge beyond screwing up traffic configurations. You'll never run out of money and never run up against a fail state that you either didn't bring upon yourself on purpose or that you didn't see coming a mile away.\\n\\nI'm really disappointed in this title.

       "  'review': 'This is the city builder people wanted back in 2013. Not to be confused with the Cities XL series, this game is done by the same people who did Cities In Motion. I finally have a good city builder to play other than SimCity 4.\\n\\n- In depth traffic simulation/planning. You can build your own interchanges/intersections/pretty much anything from scratch, and the AI will realistically follow it.\\n- Mod support (Steam Workshop enabled too). The developers even endorse modding. Does EA even know what modding is anymore?\\n- NO DRM! Yes yes, I know, SimCity doesnt need to always be online anymore. But this game has no DRM other than the cd key you get on Steam.\\n- HUGE maps. You start with a small plot of land, but are able to purchase neighboring plots as your city grows. This means you can have a sprawling metropolis with multiple town centers/airports/highway systems.\\n- The ability to divide your city in to separate districs, each able to have their own policies/taxes.\\n\\nIf you are on the fence about this game, definitely go for it. For only $30 at release, it is an excellent price for a game that will keep you entertained for a long, long time.\\n',\n",

Now they are growing! and if there is any plan to make the Cities:Skylines 2, I bet it will be much better than this.\\n\\n[i][u]Now let's take a closer look to the features, pros & cons;[/u][/i]\\n\\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]Game allows you to create your own maps, map themes, assets, mods and color corrections(LUTs). -Workshop Support-\\n[*]Dynamic water system by water source spawn points for rivers. -So you'll be able to build dams, water pumps and purification facilities.\\n[*]Free updates are satisfying. [i]-I do not reccommend you to buy DLCs for few features-[/i]\\n[*]Road Tools are good enough. -such as 'straight', 'curve', 'Free-form', 'upgrade/degrade'-\\n[*]Natural Resources -coil ore, fossil oil, fertile land-\\n[*]Dynamic Wind -affected by height and sea-\\n[*]Day/night cycle\\n[*]In-game landscaping options and decorations.\\n[*]Auto import-export according to the needs.\\n[*]Functional harbors & train stations for each, tourism and industry.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\\n[i]You can fix lots of the problems that listed below with assets and mods from workshop but each one of em will reduce your game's performance cuz they re not vanilla features[/i]\\n[list]\\n[*]Devs did not reseach and observe good enough about roads, city planning, buildings, textures and colors.\\n(ie: minimum bridge height is 12mts -Without crossing the lamps of the road under the bridge- etc)\\n[*]Road types are not enough. - Road junction angles are too big (min:45 degrees) - Road transitions are too sharp/short between large and small roads. - No merged road ramps. - Bumpy bridges upon water.\\n[*]Building zoning sizes are the same for low and high density unlikely Cities XL (max: 4x4 units = 32mtsx32mts)\\n[*]Building textures and models are not so realistic -some of em a little bit futuristic-\\n[*]Building types are not enough.\\n[*]Surface polycount of the landscape is not enough to detail it.\\n[*]Too saturated and low quality textures.\\n\\nHope it helps.

       "  'review': \"First i would like to say that the owners of this game (Paradox) are idiots.. They changed the terms of service years after releasing the game, they now collect personal data, it's in the small print. The  issue is that they did it in a way that you can't get your money back, they waited until you had purchased the game, and played it, they then changed the rules to what they collect online when you play the game, when you don't agree to the terms and services, i want to opt out of them collecting my data, for instance, the game immediately closes, and no longer allows you to play it, thus forcing you to data theft, or being out the money you invested. \\n\\nOnce i realized the bast***s that own this game did this, i requested my money back.. Only to be denied, as the game has been in my library after they changed the data collection rules. They did a bait and switch, or something that criminals do.. \\n\\nI am sure there are others like me on here who would love to file a class action law suit via a breach of contract.. Since when i purchased this game i agreed to pay money to play the game, at no point did i read that they would be using my personal data, or stealing information from my machine, to make more money off of my personal computer usage...\\n\\nThey have violated the original terms of service i signed up for.. \\n \\n\\nCan't speak for anyone else, but as an avid gamer, i will boycott everything you make, ever..\",\n",

No Maxis\\n2. No Electronic Arts\\n3. No Microtransactions\\n4. Steam Workshop\\n5. Did i mention no EA ? (just in case)\\n6. Fully working after launch\\n7. Best Dev/Publisher combined\\n8. NO BLOODY EA/MAXIS\\n\\nCons : when you fully deep into the game and downloaded so many mods from the workshop, the system requirements that were displayed on the store page were no longer in effect, you need some beefy PC's to run your city without having any troubles, especially when your city gets bigger and bigger (like 100k++ pop) so when you're about thinking of getting some mods, beware of your PC's spec, ask NASA if they have any spare left PC's unused so you can borrow them and play Cities Skylines fully modded hundreds of mods.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"City building, one of the great monuments of mankind. Isn't the blatent repurposing of the earth's bounty for our mundane consumption and shelter the epitomy what it means to be human? Yes it is. And when you play [i]Cities: Skylines[/i] you will come to appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in such an undertaking. \\n\\nIt took me seven resets before I finally got a city running properly; and even then did I throw all my progress and work out the window just because it wasn't perfect enough. City building is strategy game in the truest form. It requires long term planning and foresight. Overlooking any aspect at the start can come back to haunt you later on. Like in my first city, everything was running smoothly until everyone fell ill from polluted drinking water. The tides from the coast weren't very good at disposing the sewage. So instead of fixing it, I decided to throw all that away and found a new city alongside a flowing river instead. \\n\\nWith the water problem covered for now a new plague rose up. Power. I had to learn a few tricks from a pretty good youtuber to get the basics down; he showed you could start a city with a single wind tubine and save much more money for facilities. However, turbines are fickle and the wind is their enabler. As a result, it became a structural struggle to provide power for my budding metropolis. Once again, I threw the stuff away and started a new city, besides a river, on a hillside. \\n\\nAt this point it should be clear that this game has a significant learning curve. You really need to invest and try stuff to get the hang of it. However, it does turn out to be rewarding, as your city vivibly evolves under your direction. It is welcoming to see a game so strong in visual feedback. A bustling city is more amusing to behold than a dying one, so it is an extra motivator to keep exploring and trying for new stuff. \\n\\nNow I'm in my 5th game and power and water are no longer a problem. The real challenge presents itself when you're expanding. Expanding is hard. You basically have to create a new city from scratch, and you effectively double your resource consumption in the process. Once again, your early choices make all the differences. Depending on how you positioned your first district in regards to the highway can make all the difference for the new stream of inhabitants and commuters. You'll have to consider traffic flows from a very early point to make them work in the long run. And that is how I began my 6th city. \\n\\nSo after much trial and error, I am now running my 8th city and it is running like clockwork. I even have a booming oil and ore industry, as well as a modern office district and many options for easy living. At this point it helps to explore the extremely well crafted advisor windows. These intergrated menu screens can give you a direct glimpse into the affairs of your metropole. Fire safety, crimerate, congestion, pollution; it's all expertly depicted with easy to understand colour graphs and real time feedback from the system about current problems. The interface is such a marvel, I think more games could benefit from it. \\n\\nAs your city grows, your scope zooms out and you move away from street corner politics and small scale renovations. Your footprint grows and so does your city. [i]City: Skylines[/i] is possibly the best city building game ever made. Thanks to its direct feedback from the real time game, excellent interface and amazing graphics, it is a game worth building a city in, and then to wish you could one day live in it.\\nGranted that you don't mess up at the start because no one wants to live in highway congestion. Punishing at the start. It certainly rewards the intrepid frontier's men/women.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"For many reasons this review should carry a positive tone. This is the most played game in my steam library and I return to it consistently. With DLC there really are a lot of options to develop a realistic city. My frustration primarily lies with the fact that I played a heavily modded version of city skylines. The workshop is filled with assets and other mods that dramatically improve the game, add new functionality and correct many issues. The game is nearly constantly updated with new DLC and on occasion free content. My issues began earlier this year as the base game received an update which caused substantial mod compatibility issues, this left the game unplayable for me, and to this I have not gotten back my save that I had before this was done. I have however started a new city and was enjoying it, until yet another new update that introduces the game breaking railroad hub bug. There are a number of work arounds that I have employed with limited success. I cannot play the game reasonably until this is fixed. It has been more than 2 weeks since the appearance of this bug and there is no end in sight at least for me. I am deeply frustrated that paradox cares more about keeping their profits up by breaking an existing product just to release additional content for it, when the next game is already around the corner. Knowing that the second game will most likely come out in an unfinished state I would deeply appreciate if there was an option to at least roll back the game to a previous version so that I can enjoy the game I bought and paid for instead of waiting for them to fix the problem that didn't exist previously. It was reported on the first day of the update as well, was it really so hard to rollback the DLC until this was corrected?! I do not feel comfortable being dependent on paradox for me to be able to use a product I spent alot of money on. This makes me hesitant to recommend this game or the sequel to anyone until this concern is addressed. Either the next game can be played without using the paradox launcher and thus have version control, or it needs to have the features of the most of the mods in the workshop now on day 1 and be playable. I do not have the confidence it will be, therefore I will likely not be getting cs2 for a number of years after its release. That to me is deeply disappointing. In conclusion, city skylines was a remarkable product, if you consider all its DLC and workshop content, however on its own I would not recommend even before the missteps of this year. After the missteps of this year I cannot recommend the product even with most of the DLC. I hold out some hope for change. And at that point I will edit this review.\",\n",

Loan Simulator 2015. \\n\\nStill a better love story than SimCity.\\n\\nNo, but really. This game IS GREAT, I however suck at it which should in no means deter anyone from buying it. My roads suck, I can\\'t make an circular roundabout ramp to save my life, I named one of my districts \"Trash Town\" because all they ever do is complain about how their trash is piling up even though I BUILT 5 FUCKIN INCINERATORS NEXT TO THEM.  But, I still have a ton of fun fucking up my city. I never will second guess my decision to not become a city planner. \\n\\nWhether you are an OCD architect king or your town turns into a traffic filled, trash overflowing mess like my town, it\\'s guaranteed that this game will keep you endless entertained and inspired to make your town not suck as much ass little by little for endless amounts of time.\\n\\nI am soooo thankful for day 1 workshop in this game, people have already generated game changings mods, worlds, buildings, and most of all pre made intersections (thank you cities skylines baby jesus)\\n\\nEveryone keeps asking \"IS IT BETTER THAN SIMS CITY?!\" and YES. IT IS. I played the newest version of SimCity a day before release to kind of compare it to before I played this one.. The controls are so much more difficult to learn and understand, it feels clunkier and messier and in general like you have less to do and less control of the game. I am so impressed with the simplicity, beauty, and user friendly format that cities skylines has to offer.\\n\\nIt has already showed to be immensely popular to both play and watch others build masterpieces or piles of dirt on twitch. Something about this game is just so freakin\\' good.\\n\\nFor a $30 price tag, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has any interest in building or simulation games. You will love this game!! 10/10 :)',\n",

       "  'review': 'Cities: Skylines.... Where do I start. I have played this game for what does it say, 18 hours or something like that? I dont even know anymore. The reason I do not know anymore is because when you start playing Skylines hours in real life seem to just disappear. You can start for the first time at 8 pm and not even realize it is now well past midnight.\\n\\nYou start your city with nothing but an in an out road. Maybe a Train track. You build, you develop neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial areas just like in all the SimCity games. Eventually you get enough people to buy an expansion slot which allows you to make your city bigger, and bigger and bigger until eventually you have this huge map that seems like there is no end to it. \\n\\nThe only grip I would say I have about this game is that there is a max amount of expansion slots you can buy for your city. Which I guess is alright, but it would be nice if you could just keep going and going. Then again I dont know how well that would work or even if you could keep up with maintaining the whole city from Burned Down buildings or abandonded buildings, or making sure there are enough Cemetarys in your city to go an pick up all the dead bodies each day. \\n\\nDo I recommend this game? Fuck yeah.',\n",

There are very few bugs if any, few things i dislike about this game are DLC is very important to this game, the DLC adds so much more content then base.  Base game is playable just lacks a large variety of things to do, the base game is rather just build city roads, zone the R.C.I areas and make money. The DLCs are kinda expensive for the content given but they add a lot to the game.

       "  'review': \"First time review but felt compelled to about this game. If you are a fan of the whole tycoon, city building genre then Cities SKylines is for you.\\n\\nThe support of the product through the workshop is like a treasure trove filled with replica buildings, unique designs and detailed assets which allow you to craft almost anything you can imagine within your city.\\n\\nThe mods can be a little bit frustrating and dangerous to your save games but handled correctly (I'd highly recommend reading about the mods you are thinking about using in the workshop before downloading any) they add even more oppotunities to develop the gameplay, fixing minor frustrations and adding more simplitic and unique controls.\\n\\nIf you are new to the genre then this is an excellent game to start from. Great value, it was only £22 when it first came out, and an even better workshop, this gane will suck you in for hours.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit July 17, 2019\\nStarted the game to see if any of these issues have been fixed and the hundreds of saved games are gone.\\n\\nEdit July 19, 2019\\nFound one of my backup files and started playing again hoping some of the issues would now work.  Left the game run for a bit and the city collapsed due to many of the roads being damaged, looks like an earthquake, however disasters and weather are turned off.  Anyone else have this issue?\\n\\nDespite many complaints (check the forums and negative complaints) including my own the game still has bugs.  I\\'ve enjoyed this style of game since the first Simcity.  The bugs don\\'t appear right away with a smaller city as such everything seems fine at first and the game is enjoyable.  After spending hours building your city up is when the issues start to become apparent.  Some people have managed to make a large city without issue but many have not so its hard to say where the problem lies.(different windows versions, certain DLC, etc)  This may explain all the positive reviews as most haven\\'t played long enough to have this issue and some were lucky enough that the issues never manifested on there system.  After spending hours building your city up is when the issues start to become apparent.  I have spent a lot of time on building multiple cities trying to narrow down the problems and insure that it wasn\\'t my city design.  The first and main issue is garbage.  There is a great article in the forums on how its handled called \"Garbage is Rubbish\", however all those issues aren\\'t game breakers.  As your city becomes larger the incinerators send out less and less trucks.  There is no logical reason for this to happen.  Many have suggested poor traffic layout is the issue but even if it were (its not in my case) it still has no logic.  \"There is a traffic jam across town don\\'t send out any garbage trucks across the entire city but pay everyone for the day.\"  Traffic is another whole issue that could take up a paragraph but again its not game breaking just unrealistic, annoying, and somewhat limits any creativity you may have in your city design.  With average happiness running close to 90%, traffic efficiency averaging around 90%, and 20 times the required incinerator capacity there shouldn\\'t be any issues but it breaks somewhere between 150,000-300,000 population every time and garbage trucks just stop running across the entire city and of course the entire city collapses.  Crematoriums seem to have a similar issue but I\\'ve never had them get to the point of complete collapse.  Mods were added to see if any of them would help but they didn\\'t.  Tech support was of no help and of course denied there was any issue.\\nWhile experimenting with the garbage issue I noticed something else.  Your net  income isn\\'t entirely based on fixed game factors and adjusts itself.  I can only guess this is an attempt to maintain some semblance of difficulty and \\'balance\\' so you can\\'t let your game run for days to have a large bank account even if you design the perfect city.  At first I thought it might be my city design and management that my profits were never very large but as a lot of time and experimentation went on there is more to it.  The best example which was tried several times with different cities is that a good size city ran for a couple (real) days without making any changes and though the weekly income bounced around slightly it averaged out at pretty close to $0 and the overall bank account hadn\\'t really changed very much.  A mod was added that quartered the garbage costs, the mod doesn\\'t affect any other game mechanics and no other changes were made.  At the time garbage costs were around $200,000 so they quartered to $50,000.  In theory after this the net profit should average out to $150,000 but this wasn\\'t the case.  Initially the profit jumps up to close to this amount but after a short while it settled in around an average profit of $15,000 and then stays there.  It seems no matter what was done it would never maintain anything over $20,000 average net profit for more than a short burst.\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that all my play time was basically beta testing instead of just playing and enjoying the game.\\nIn closing this game has so much going for it and most of the issues it has are minor and could be overlooked if they could only fix the big issues.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I really like this game, and I would love to be able to recommend it, but it\\'s flaws late game eventually outweigh it\\'s strengths, so I can\\'t. The concept is beautiful. The abundance of detail and balance between macro and micro-management put all other city building games to shame. The details and feeling of creating and building something are exactly what you would hope for in a game like this. The community and mods are great and contribute wonderfully to the game. The progression from small town into large city is clean, along with the management decisions you are required to make regarding budget, design, expansion, etc. Then the problems start to show up. \\n\\nThe most popular complaint is a very valid one: traffic is bad. The AI make unreasonable and confusing choices with regards to traffic, and even well designed cities with proper infrastructure have highly unreasonable and unnatural traffic jams. This can only be worked around by taking extreme measures with road layouts- it is impossible to design a normal-looking city that doesn\\'t have completely destructive traffic patterns. Certain facets of the game are not clearly explained, such as taxes (income based vs property based), how industries supply the city, what the \"Not enough goods to sell\" error means, etc., and require players to make educated guesses or search forums to find out. The scale of houses/buildings size to people is seriously off- you really have to use your imagination to get around the issue with scale. Things that should be a part of the base game are sold as DLC, and without the DLC, the quality of play is compromised. The population count is highly unrealistic. There are massive death waves, and the deathcare services are extraordinarily inefficient. All public services, for that matter, are inefficient. Fire and police departments, waste services, schools, parks, and other public buildings have unrealistically short ranges, forcing you to build far too many. Finally, and in my opinion worst of all, you just simply can\\'t build a big city without massive issues with lag or the game crashing outright, even with a beast of a computer running the lowest settings.',\n",

I've been playing since the game was released and as such I've had plenty of time to familiarize myself with all the fantastic community-made modifications and additions to the game. If you just started playing Cities I'd really recommend to wait with mods and start introducing them slowly as it is very hard to learn both the game and it's mods at once. I had this experience when I tried getting into Sim City 4, which was another fantastic game but one I never really felt I could master. Don't compare yourself to others and take your time. Eventually, anything is possible and you'll love this game as much as I do.\\n\\n/Teddy\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I enjoy games like this, and this is probably one of the best games i\\'ve ever played for its kind. If there was a \"Semi-recommend\" option rather than just the \"Recommend\" and \"Not Recommended\" option, i\\'d choose it. The reason for it being not recommended is that some of the features in the game are not very well made or \"Optimized\" for it; traffic is the best example. I wont explain traffic because its a common problem explained in MANY other \"Not recommended\" reviews that explain its flaws way better than i can. My biggest problem is the DLC; Most of the more expensive DLC are quite literally features that should be in the base game alone, it doesnt make sense (other than to milk your money from you) to put them behind a heafty paywall. After Dark, Snowfall, Mass Transit, and Green Cities should be in the game itself in the original purchase, not DLC. Natural Disasters could be argued weither or not it should or shouldnt be in the base game.\\n\\nI would recommend it if it was on sale, but the DLC isn\\'t something i ever intend on buying since it seems like stuff i shouldnt HAVE to buy in the first place, it should be free or already in the game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Initially...? LOTS of fun! Simple. Go to Steam, hit Play. Play game. Now? In two words... \"Paradox Launcher\". Fuck that. Does anyone even READ the \"license agreement\" when it automatically installs this pointless launcher? The *ONLY* reason it is there is to steal your personal info, keep an eye on everything you are doing, and report that back to them to do with whatever they please.\\n\\n!!! See my UPDATE, below about how to \\'bypass\" this launcher with a simple program someone created to do just that. No muss, no fuss. (And no malware or virus according to my multiple checks...and it\\'s on GitHub, with source, so...yeah...)!!!\\n\\nWhy, Paradox? Are you just that fucking greedy and neurotic? Why can\\'t just just let someone make a fun game, let them give you money, and be done with it? What give\\'s you the right to force a customer to be chained to your personal desires for all time? The whole \"commerce\" concept is REALLY simple: You make something I want. I give you money for it. We shake hands and you are happy you have money, I am happy I have your product...and we NEVER HAVE TO SEE OR DEAL WITH EACH OTHER EVER AGAIN! Yet, somehow, the \\'digital world\\' (re: publishers, mostly) seem to think a customer giving them money also entitles them to private details of that customer as well as spy on everything they do. Forever.\\n\\nNope. I\\'m out. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Make a statement. Until we (gamers/consumers) grow a pair, it\\'s only going to get worse. In 20 years companies will be forcing people to let them log into any and all digital devices and signals, phones, video cams, smart appliances, etc, to watch and listen to them... \"to better serve them\". Think I\\'m crazy? yeah...get back to me in 20 years and we\\'ll see...',\n",

       "  'review': \"Coming from Sim City way back in the day I misunderstood so much about this game. I have had this in my library since release and played off and on building cities and giving up at the, seemingly, unavoidable traffic apocalypse. I never quite enjoyed it as much as Sim City and I sort of forgot about it until the Plazas and Promenades DLC popped up. \\n\\nBeing out of the game for so long I started looking up some YouTube videos to jog my memory a bit. I came across [url=www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOe8ZlWEf90&list=PLW9ZbMsZn0d5MGKEw9et_NKxhuEG6rC8e]Overcharged Egg's Noobs guide[/url] and started watching that on my secondary monitor while I stumbled my way through the game. His videos have been game-changing. I went from mildly enthusiastic to severely obsessed in a matter of days. \\n\\nThis is easily the best city builder out there. From controlling infrastructure to detailing my districts. From using the vanilla game to deep diving into the mod scene. I cannot stress how much game there is to find here. The pro's on YouTube also provide endless inspiration for sprawling city builds.\\n\\nThe DLCs add so much to the base game as well. Each one provides meta games within the original framework. The game and DLCs can also be found for ridiculously low prices. What more could you ask for?\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I like this game very much. Dont misunderstand me. It is pretty good.\\n\\nBut since release they did not fixed the well known annoying bugs:\\n\\n-Broken traffic -> Cars only chose the straightest way. So in a six lane street they will stand all behind each other and all other lanes are free. You can compensate it by either building many shortage-pathes for your cars to split the traffic or by using a mod which improve traffic habits a bit (but not optimally).\\n\\n-Service cars are pretty bad in servicing. Also need here a mod for.\\n\\n-Low vehicle limit in the city, which is compensated in the engine by magically despawning cars. Need a mod to disable despawning for real traffic simulation (mentioning that traffic simulation is an heavily sold aspect of the game). But that hits the low vehicle limit pretty hard. For powerful computer there is no option to raise that limit, even as requested since long. Needed another mod to allow service cars to spawn prior non-service cars if you hit the limit (which is pretty soon).\\n\\n-Bad multi-threading, known since engine release. Unity engine got fixed this problem and released since ages the official update for it (easy to implent), which Colossal Order refuses to implent, yet.\\n\\n-DLC politics. Sadly the new way of the publisher to squeeze money. I like Paradox, they have a community-focused and innovative way to produce titles. Im a huge fan of their series (EU, HoI, CK). But they sell content in a city-builder as DLCc, which was already included in games as SimCity1 (e.g. disaster).',\n",

       "  'review': 'I have spent hundreds of hours playing this game, but I cannot recommend it in its current form. It is an excellent idea for how to do an amazing city builder game, but its execution has been extremely poor. I cannot say I would have enjoyed the vast majority of my playtime without the heavy number of mods I had to install to get the game to place that I considered it to be minimally functional. These were not cosmetic or fun mods, these were things that I considered absolutely necessary and should have been a part of the base game.\\n\\nOverall, every time they release new DLC for this game, I grow less and less interested in it. Each new content pack breaks the game even more. They just keep piling on new ideas without attempting to fix the very serious problems with the mechanics of this game or even attempting to integrate new content into the existing systems. Each new content pack seems to keep the same prices with less and less content added as a part of the pack. I can only conclude that the developers are keeping this alive to milk it for all the money they can and are intent on completely ignoring the glaring issues within it.\\n\\nThis game is very addicting if you can get it to work. But I cannot recommend it as a good game.',\n",

The DLC is in the typical paradox system, but for the most part, it is worth it. This game is one of the most rewarding and frustrating out there, from its sometimes convoluted mechanics, to it's real sense of progression, I don't think any time i spent in this game was wasted. The game has some quirks, like the fact that it's very hard to build tunnels under water because of it being too steep. The DLC is highly recommended to be able to play the game to the fullest, the best ones in my opinion are mass transit and green cities, but industries is also great. Overall I'd give it a [b] 8/10 [/b], because of the dlc.\",\n",

Cities: Skylines is the game I've been waiting for for a decade!  It's been a joy learning to play it, developing my city building strategies, and building MY city.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake for me, is when I'm waiting for my budget to generate enough money to implement my next improvement or build, I can pick out a citizen, and follow them around.  Doing this gives me insight into how I can make my city a better place for that citizen to live in...whether it's improving the transit system, putting in some commercial zones closer to their house, etc.  Being able to see real citizens going about their day to day tasks from cradle to grave is amazing.\\n\\nI bought this game based on the early positive reviews I read, and I have nothing but praise to add to them.  I won't be surprised if this ends up as GOTY...no doubt it will be a nominee.  I haven't been this excited about a simulation in a LONG time!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'On Jan 22, 2020, Paradox interactive released a \\'launcher\\' for Cities Skylines.  They knew the launcher would be unpopular, given by their announcement post title reading: \"Yet another launcher, please don\\'t riot.\"\\n\\nWhat followed in the forums has been a mass of damage control, user censorship, and betrayal of the gamer base. (*1, *2, *17)\\n\\nSome History, why does this matter?\\n\\nEA released SimCity back in 2013, and with it was an always on-line system that didn\\'t work, and it caused countless issues.  The company didn\\'t care what their users said about it, they forced it on everyone. It caused no end of issues with many people unable to just play the game, and users in frustration giving up on SimCity, and others, like me, who didn\\'t buy into after hearing about all the problems.  Plus, there were a number of game play issues.  The game was visually better then previous SimCity games, but was frustratingly limited in what you could do and how big of a play area you had. (*3)\\n\\nWhat came of it?\\n\\n2 years later, Paradox Interactive (publisher) and Colossal Order (developer) created Cities Skylines.  It was hailed as the spiritual successor at the time. For all intents and purposes it was, and for almost 5 years, and a dozen DLCs, has been the premier City Builder game on the market.  Others have come and gone, but it remained #1.  It wasn\\'t perfect, had some bugs, some serious, but over time, the game smoothed out and was really great. (*4)\\n\\nWhat has changed?\\n\\nParadox Interactive has decided to put all of their products into a single \\'launcher\\' type application.  It seems so far that the goal is to create a Origin/Epic/Steam style game launcher to sell their products under.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the problem then?\\n\\nThe problem is, they have decided to do this with the existing game, and they\\'ve done it poorly.  What we actually have is a \\'launcher in a launcher\\' problem.  their launcher doesn\\'t manage the deployment of Skylines and other paradox games, they\\'ve left that up to steam.  The issue is, it\\'s creating conflicts within Steam because Cities Skylines is deeply integrated with the Steam Workshop for mod delivery.   The launcher is causing massive issues for many players.\\n\\nWhat they have told us is the launcher was for adding features like mod management and advertising to the game, but this is on top of a launcher (Steam) that already does mod management and advertising.  This is subjecting users to extra steps to start the game and in some cases, renders the game unplayable, or destroying user maps.\\n\\nThe community has asked them to remove the launcher, but they refuse.  Thus, why the history mattered.  A workaround was discovered to bypass the launcher, and many users went with that.  But to this day, months later The launcher still prevents users from playing the game, with no relief in sight.  A game they payed for is still unplayable.\\n\\nWhat else happened?\\n\\nAlong with this unpopular launcher (*8, *7) came the Paradox Representatives in the forums. When the complaints started to come in, the PRs on the forums started calling users names and badmouthing users and such. (*5)  It got nasty quick. Paradox pulled those problem PRs (*6) but the damage was done. (*9, note: nothing done about it.) Paradox\\'s true feelings towards their users had been revealed.\\n\\nStack these two issues together and those of us who remember the EA fiasco realzied it was EA 2.0 all over again.\\n\\nWhat is this launcher, anyway?\\n\\nBy definition, it\\'s a Trojan. (*10) When you purchase the game, on the Steam Store page, it does not list the use of 3rd party software, like what you see with Origin and Uplay games.  Before the update, if you clicked \\'Play\\' in Steam, Cities Skylines would start right away.  After the update, when you clicked \\'Play\\' a \\'MSI style installer\\' would launch.  It gave zero options to control the install, nor the option to cancel it.  It also did not install in the game directory, but in a hidden area in your User profile on Windows.  What this meant was if it broke, Steam could not fix it, and when you \\'uninstalled\\' Skylines from Steam, the launcher stayed behind.  So, you think your about to start Cities Skylines, and you got their launcher instead.\\n\\nThe real thing is, this launcher on Steam is NOT the same as the one they list on their site. (*12, *11)\\n\\n[quote] \\n\"Ahhh! Nothing quite like a confusing naming scheme! The Paradox Launcher found at play.paradoxplaza.com is our “Distribution Client”, something similar to the Steam Client if you will. This client development has been on the back burner for some time while the team has been focused on the “splash screen” launcher you are probably here to read about.\\n\\nIn a not too far off future (we hope), these two functions - splash screen and distribution client - will be consolidated for those of our customers who choose to play through the PDX Distribution system. Other users shouldn’t notice any change from the current situation, though.\"\\n[/quote]\\n\\nWhat does this launcher do?\\n\\nAdvertising, mostly.  It is basically, Spyware. (*13, item 6)  It\\'s actual primary purpose is to gather and collect user data and transmit that data back to their providers that include: (*14 section 6, *15)\\n\\n[quote]Market Research Agencies (like for example Nielsen, Kantar Media)\\nGame distribution platforms (for example Steam)\\nCo-publishing partners (for example, Eugen Systems SA)\\nPayment providers (for example, Adyen, PayPal)\\nCompanies and external consultants that help support our platform and services (for example, Gamespark sand Salesforce)\\nAdvertising partners and attribution platforms to help us understand the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns (for example, Google, Facebook, and Adjust)\\nMarketing services (for example Survey Monkey and Mailchimp)[/quote]\\n\\nEveryone does this, right?  Why such the big deal?\\n\\nFor this Launcher, it is its primary purpose.  Companies make a lot of money selling user data. (*16)  The reason this is such a big deal is because for 5 years, this wasn\\'t happening.  The choice to ignore Paradox and their accounts and just Play the game is all their was.  They gave an incentive to create an account by offering an in game item if you logged into them, but now, it\\'s much worse.  This launcher does its best to force you into signing up, and \\nonly offers a tiny \\'skip\\' option to get around it, nagging the user until they give in. \\n\\nThis is also where the history matters.  EA forced their users around, and when Paradox came out with Cities Skylines, it was preceded by the community that they \\'got it\\' in regards on how to treat their users.  For 5 years, this was the perception.  Until now.  Given now how Paradox is deleting posts, corralling users around the forums to minimize the appearance of how this looks, all damage control to cover for the fact they are forcing this onto the community with the hopes it will just \\'go-away\\' before they move on to their next steps in this.\\n\\nWhat about Colossal Order?  What do they say?\\n\\nI actually reached out to them.  They basically said, they don\\'t own the IP to the game they are making, and that they don\\'t have a choice in the matter.  They are being forced into this.  They didn\\'t come out and oppose the launcher, but they also didn\\'t say they support it either.  They basically have no choice.\\n\\nWhat can be done?\\n\\nSTOP, right were you are, and don\\'t buy the game or any more DLC.  Don\\'t support a company that sells-out their users to Google and other data collection big tech firms.  Make a Stand, say NO!  Start right here, make a difference!  They already sold us out who\\'ve been playing the game for years and stole our money and sold us out, but if you have not bought the game, or it\\'s DLC, please, make a difference, don\\'t buy it! say NO to Google sellouts!\\n\\n[url=https://tygrakhan.blogspot.com/2020/03/review-of-cities-skylines-expanded.html]Full version with sources and references.[/url]\\n\\nR.I.P.

       "  'review': \"Wow, how to review this game...fantastic? yeah closest word i can think of. its unbelievably awesome and addicting. its one of those games that you can hop on for a quick half hour before work, or do a long hual all night grinding at building your metropolis. I'll go ahead and mention the cons even though they in no way amount to anything significant enough to not get it. As a lot of people mention the traffic AI is frustrating, maybe the biggest challenge of the game. but in reality traffic is a major challenge for every city. The whole ratio of times thing is weird but best they could do i imagine. i wish the city size to population was realisitc. You have this massive metroplex with skyscrapers, multiple airports and countless suburbs and the entire population of the city is like 65000. that makes no sense. idk why they have it like that. the expansions are seemingly really expensive for what they give you so that sucks too. but just the base game is awesome. anyway overall awesome if you have a decent rig that can run it smoothly its a very relaxing but engaging gaming experience.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The go to game for city building, the authority, a no-brainer recommendation.\\n\\n \\n[h1]The history:[/h1]\\nCities: Skylines filled a void that SimCity created. Once SimCity was king of citybuilders. They were all solid, except the last installment. That game pushed details and beauty, but to make it playable for non-high-end pc's, they severely limited the greath of the sandbox. This design decision went against the game itself: a sandbox game shouldn't have a shortage of sand. I think the ambition killed the game.\\nAt that time I think they released some DLC, but it was a pretty new concept, which I refused to buy.\\nThen after a few year of nothing came Cities: Skylines. It gave players what they wanted: a game not too demanding for the pc, but without immediate limits. And it works really well! Now 5 years later it's still the ruler of the City Builders. Happy with this game, but sad EA let an icon die...\\n\\n[h1]Things I wish they improved:[/h1]\\nZoneing - the concept of zoneing should be reworked. The zones for industry, parks and universities are absolete. Just zoneing for policies is enough.\\nTraffic tools - unmodded the game handles traffic really poor.\\n\\n[h1]The dlc's:[/h1]\\nTwo times a year the game gets a dlc. They provide sidegrades of the game mainly, to provide richer tools.\\nAfter Dark - tourism is nice, but day-night cycle should be part of base game.\\nSnowfall - a very mediocre dlc. It's nice to play in a snowmap during december, but very boring during other times. This dlc should be reworked to make snow an option on normal maps.\\nNatural disasters - fun for a short while. It introduced scenarios, which are great!\\nMass transit - fantastic!\\nGreen cities - solidation. While nice, could be part of base game.\\nParklife - really nice sandbox tools. However the firemen can't enter parks, so it always turns into a collection of ash.\\nIndustries - 4 big specialisations. I really like this dlc!\\nCampus - nice!\\nSunset harbor - small and (too) simple. There are 4 types of fish, but are the same product.\\nRadio stations - all bad.\\nSkin packs - I always forget to use them.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've been enjoying C:S for almost two years now. I tried to run it off of a 2nd or 3rd-gen i5 processor with native graphics and that flopped at first. But, 6 months later, I bought a laptop with a 6th-gen 4-core i7 and NVIDIA GTX 960M. The fans run loud, but the game runs beautifully at 1080p maxed out. So, before you read the review, read this to get a sense of the game's needs.\\n\\nLet's now get into the actual review! First off, one of the things I immediately noticed playing C:S was the amount of freedom you're given. So much land, so many different building options & features--this game has it all! And here I am, more than four years after the release, going on about C:S! Something else that was noticeable was the workshop support. I am glad to say that NO OTHER GAME I know of on Steam has this much support on the Workshop. There are literal MILLIONS of items to download onto C:S. At least hundreds of thousands. And, while some are better than others, they all combine to make your game a better one in the long run. Plus, everything is customizable, meaning the game can cater to my needs as well. Lastly, there is no other game like C:S. Although SimCity tries (and fails) to keep up, no other game can surpass the level of support, freedom, or amount of time you can play this game for without getting bored of it. One of the greatest parts includes how you make what you want. Mods are needed, sure, but everything you do in C:S is basically original to you. It's a your-eyes-only game or a community-shared game. It all depends on what you want to do. And, you get to choose that decision!\\n\\nI can't seem to find any major thing wrong with Cities: Skylines. I cannot stress to you how freakin' much I love this game or how the team is still creating major updates and packs 4 years after launch. I expected to play this 1-2 years max. But, my expectations were outdone. This entire review is honestly an understatement, and honest. You can't forget that I am being 100% honest when I say it's worth the money. Packs? Maybe... But, whatever you're thinking about this game, it should be positive, because that's all I think when i play this game. Thank you and good night.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is a worthy successor to Sim City 4(Sim City 2013 was a flop, imo) that offers depth and quality worthy for any city builder enthuasist.  The game offers a diverse and massive modding community, which is a key to enhancing any city building game, and not to mention it's easily accessible with Steam Workshop.  This game also earns a plus on a near flawless release(when compared to its competition), and I have confidence that it become more than what Sim City 4 had became, in less amount of time(Sim City 4 does have a decade+ of development).  \\nMy only complaint, and it's merely opinion oriented, is I wish this game used a darker saturation for the color of its buildings and vehicles.  I personally wish they would have used a similar color scheme as Cities in Motion 2(for realism).  However, with the mod community, you are able to change this.  With that said, this is a must add for anyones library, you will not be disappointed if you enjoy city building.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]After 10 hours[/h1]\\n\\nThis has been a very pleasant city simulator so far in big part due to the user-friendly user interface and mechanics. The city is a joy to build, prod and tweak and you only need a few keys and your mouse buttons. While many good lessons have been learned from mobile gaming (simple menu structures, addictive feedback FX, hint stream, etc.), the game offers a good amount of depth, freedom and player challenge. The city will grow automatically but not run itself and will certainly need a strategist and grand architect. The player's role is as it should be: balancing, optimising and developing the city, not monitoring every last building and citizen, yet you still can if you want to! Speaking of, the citizens behave in a consistent and logical manner (if not an entirely rational one, but that is arguably good simulation!), making the city feel alive and controllable.\\n\\n[b]tl;dr[/b] - Fun to play, full mechanics, satisfies tweakers, AI is good.\\n\\nThe Steam Workshop support brings a massive boost to the content just weeks after release: if you struggle with building intersections like I do, there are dozens, even hundreds of ready-made and user-tested Workshop ones available! No more eternal gridlock! There are also buildings, decorations and all sorts of stuff if the basic selection gets too repetitive. The default selection is nicely finished and has a good level of detail.\\n\\n[b]tl;dr[/b] - Steam Workshop provides ideas, help and variety.\\n\\nThe only negatives so far are the pretty limited soundtrack, not enough variety in Chirper messages, no road ruler (grid), and the Steam Workshop items are missing their thumbnails. These are minor inconveniences so far and two can be circumvented; play your own music and keep a manageable number of content installed so you know what is what. The roads do snap straight, but sometimes it is not clear when they do, and different angles are hard to produce accurately.\\n\\nAll in all a great experience so far, and I haven't seen half the content yet!\\n\\nPS. Compared to SimCity? Better flow, nicer UI mechanics, less obtuse, better mod and community support - and no EA/Origin! There is a Paradox account you can register, but it is not mandatory. I don't know how the performance will be once my city reaches beyond two map squares, but so far there have been no slowdowns or glitches.\\n\\n[h1]After 24 hours[/h1]\\n\\nStill going strong; the game has switched focus from pure growth to efficiency and large-scale management. I still get to build simple and fun new places (these maps feel pretty huge), but the core of the city is now an optimiser's dream. Education, roadworks and public transit are a real balancing act.\\n\\nI still can't get enough even after failing two cities miserably - they just feel like learning experiences. My main city is a place I constantly want to go back to and build and improve.\\n\\nThe engine shows no signs of slowing down or glitching even with four (or was it five) map squares built, and game load times are fantastic. No real bugs or glitches in sight, everything Just Works. Except Tweeter; that thing is really starting to annoy me, because it has no relevance or variety anymore.\\n\\nStill very much Recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I love this game, deep down and with my whole heart. It is THE best city-building simulator out there. There is a reason why SimCity failed and this game is still thiving, with an active community behind it giving it all the love it deserves. It takes all the things we loved about the old SimCity, Cities in Motion, CitiesXL and countless other citybuilders and applies it to a modern game.\\n\\nNow, if the game is so great, why don't I recommend getting the game you ask?\\n\\nIt has all to do with the toxic DLC policy of the publisher of the game, which runs a large aspect of it. Cities Skyline is a great game... IF you can afford all the DLC. Paradox shows us again how to NOT have a great basegame with DLC that adds, instead we get a new DLC every month that is almost mandatory to play the game properly.\\n\\nIf you think I'm wrong and the game is completly fine on its own, try to disable all the DLC and mods and start up a new game. You are severely limited in what you can do. \\n\\nAt this point, I can't recommend a game that will string you on into a pay2play environment. They could at least be honest and add a monthly subscription to it, instead of hiding it behind DLC.\\n\\n<3 for Colossal Order for creating such a beautiful, wonderful game.\\n</3 for Paradox, completly ruining this amazing game with their toxic DLC policy.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is a fantastic city building game, but if you are looking for the ability to drive around your city as shown in Sim City 3 and up, not quite it. I\\'m also going to give you a warning that this game may eat away at your hours. \\n\\nReading over the reviews, I\\'ve seen this game a multitude of times compared to Sim City. The biggest comparison I see is that, this game has been labelled \"easier\". In some sense it\\'s true, but when you realize how big your city can be and the unique styles you can give to your roads, it can get complicated. The game is about building up a city, but eventually turns into managing one instead of it managing itself. \\n\\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] is relatively simple. Everything is laid out for you, and as your city grows, so does your ability to build upgraded or newer buildings. Taxes can be adjusted, budgets can be adjusted (for parks, buses, water works, electricity etc...), and loans can be taken out. Even if you are not extremely familiar how economics work in a municipality, the game does it\\'s best to advise you of everything going on. Placing police stations, fire stations, hospitals, or even schools becomes very easy as the game does an extremely good job in showing which areas are covered. What can drive a few people nuts is putting water pumps near sewage dumps. At first, you may smile as you see water is being delivered to your residents and that the sewage water is far away (especially in the first level with the lake). You\\'ll then notice a lot of water being polluted and eventually making it\\'s way up to your water pumps. \\n\\nIt is imperative that my readers know to build down stream or to use water towers where sewage may be an issue! They also make it easy to see what crime rates are (check the top left of your screen), what your citizens happiness is, pollution, electricity and water availability, natural resources and a few others. The biggest feature in the game to me it seems, is the ability to really architect the roads. In Sim City, you are able to put zones wherever you please. In Skylines, you have only the choice to build near roads. Zoning is made easy and can be done with a fill brush tool or individual squares can be assigned. A huge feature in Skylines is districts. Districts are designed by you and are designated by you as well. Want a forest industry? Want a mining industry? Want a farming industry by residential areas? This can be done through districts. Definitely a notable feature in the game. Bus stops and other sort of transport is available. They try to give you as much control as possible within the game. Bus stops are designated by you and are placed where you\\'d like them to be. At first it is difficult to control where the bus goes when placing the stops, but choosing the RIGHT side of the road is important for it to work properly! \\n\\n[b]Visuals and sounds[/b] are appropriate. The music is neither condemning or over the top, but the repitid Sounds follow your screen, and you will hear buildings burn if they are on fire. At first glance, I thought traffic was extremely horrible in my city. I zoomed in closer and saw they actually park their cars in front of their house. Good to see the attention to detail put in. \\n\\nI bought this game on sale and am quite content with the product. I would like to have a feature where I can drive through my city or even go on a rampage with a truck. Maybe it\\'s asking too much from a city builder, but having complete control like this is what differentiates the best from the rest.\\n\\nRATING : 7.5/10\\n\\n[table]\\n[tr]\\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\\n\\t[td]B+[/td]\\n[/tr]\\n[tr]\\n\\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\\n\\t[td]N/A[/td]\\n[/tr]\\n[tr]\\n\\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\\n\\t[td]B[/td]\\n[/tr]\\n[tr]\\n\\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\\n\\t[td]B[/td]\\n[/tr]\\n[tr]\\n\\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\\n\\t[td]B-[/td]\\n[/tr]\\n[tr]\\n\\t[td]Overall [/td]\\n\\t[td]B[/td]\\n[/tr]\\n[/table]\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1]ScreenShots :[/h1] \\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451000081] SCREENSHOT 1[/url] \\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448045663] SCREENSHOT 2 [/url]\\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=455799370] Pretty much completed[/url]\\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=496128649] Not the ideal screenshot of showing off a bridge [/url]\\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=496128699] I thought the bus stops in my city were crowded[/url]\\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497139701] Even emergency vehicles do not pass a funeral procession[/url]',\n",

       "  'review': \"When I was a child, I had a dog growing up. She was a golden retriever named Sparkey and she was the best damn dog a kid could ever have. Was she perfect? No. She would seek out and consume cat poop and begged at the table when we tried to have dinner, but I didn't care. She was an awesome dog and I spent hours playing with her. \\n\\nNear the end of her life, her liver shut down. She started to shit and puke in the house, and even started to snap at me; she was in a lot of pain. In the end the vet suggested we put her down. It was a sad day. I had lost a best friend that I had for years, but it was for the best. \\n\\nLater we got a new dog. A Yellow Lab/German Shepard mix named Milo. Milo was not Sparky, but he is still an awesome dog. Playful, good with kids, cutely vocal and a big lump who's good for hugging. He isn't perfect either, he sheds like crazy, but that doesn't make him a bad dog. \\n\\nWhy did I ramble on about dogs? \\n\\nThe Sim City Franchise is Sparkey, with 5imCity 2013 being her post liver-failure. A game series I remember fondly as the stuff of my childhood, willfully editing out what happened at the very end. \\n\\nCities: Skylines is Milo. A new dog, a different dog, but an awesome dog. \\n\\nIf you are a fan of city building games at all, you are going to want to pick this game up right now. It is only $30 AT LAUNCH. That is not a sale price, that is the full undiscounted price and it is worth double that (which, by the way, is what 5imCity 2013 cost at launch). It is stable and fun out of the box and with adamant mod support and a dev team that is actively listening to the community feedback, it will get even better. \\n\\n\",\n",

With mods, the game becomes the best city building game ever made, by far (at least if you're like me and are looking more to create a pretty and atmospheric city rather than enjoy deep management and simulation gameplay).\\n\\n\\tA massive catalogue of cosmetic mods (both for adding new assets and tweaking the graphics) and robust asset editing combined with utility mods like Prop Anarchy and MoveIt makes it possible to have everything looking just how you want it. I treat this game as more of a canvas to paint on than a game to play.\\n\\n\\tColossal Order have released several free updates to fix bugs and have been generally good at listening to the playerbase. My personal biggest complaint, the traffic AI, hasn't been fixed although there is talk of changing it in the future.\\n\\n\\tThe base game goes on sale regularly and a large majority of the mods don't require any DLC, so it's been good value for me.\\n\\n\\nIf you're looking to interact deeply with your citizens, scheme political and diplomatic schemes and solve complex civil engineering problems, you might find this game lacking. If you want to build an atmospheric, aesthetically pleasing model city then I can strongly recommend Cities: Skylines.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"i picked this game up on humble bundle for a buck. well worth the cost. you build a city by placing roads and setting zones along the borders of roads. buildings of the type will automatically build in the zones when there is demand. your citizens need things like power, water, education, healthcare, etc. you need to build those buildings with the tax money you collect to keep your citizens happy. as your population increases, you unlock new buildings and features to add to your town such as buses, better buildings, and more control over neighborhoods.\\n\\nthe game does have a lot of DLC, some of which does look like it proabbaly should have been in the base game, but if you don't read into the DLC's description, you wouldn't even know your missing it. the game only does not show you DLC buildings if you don't own the DLC, so it is very easy to ignore the DLC and just have fun in the base game\\n\\nedit: I liked the game enough I got the whole bundle. It comes with all the major DLC except park life and sunset harbor as well as including a few of the other not important DLCs\",\n",

Though of course Simcity will always be in the hearts of those who originally played it, I know it is for me, but one thing I can say about Cities...\\nPaywall behind all its content.. But other than that if you can look past the paywalls its a great game.\\n\\n\\nBefore:\\n The game is great and all, but Its not at all optimized for Low end PC players. I always seem to have to stop playing the game after abit due to how bad it is; my PC also lags like crazy after shutting it down. I wish I could experience the better but for now I want to say its not great for those with potatoes.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I have a lot to say about this game. I am currently at about 1000 hours of play time and I can tell that my money was spend well. I highly recommend this to everybody interested in city builders or who is looking for a relaxing game with progress in it.\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[b]The most positive aspects are:[/b]\\n+ very beginner friendly, comes with a [u]non[/u] intrusive tutorial\\n+ Open communication with the enormous community, also really great support\\n+ regular updates, with lots of improvements\\n+ a variety of good DLC that can Improve your game, but are NOT essential (e.g Natural Disasters or Industries)\\n+ the game gets more difficutlt the bigger your city gets, so it doesnt get boring, just more challenging. additionally , the game can be made more easy/ difficult in the content manager.\\n+ most mods are only necessary for advanced players and those that want to change certain aspects of the game (e.g building a vietnamese themed city, therefore adding horizontal trafic lights)\\n+ Almost completly bug free ( see below )\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[b]On the other hand the most negative aspects are:[/b]\\n- a lot of small DLC that should be implemented in the base game, or at least be available for free (e.g content creator packs)\\n- \"intense\" modding (20+ Mods and/or 1000* Assest) causes the game to multiply the loading times by a factor of 100, its also the only steam game I know of that causes such a hugh variety of problems with modding\\n- Some mods (e.g Traffic Manager) are [u]necessery[/u] for even basic players/ everybody above beginner\\n- a lack of features for advanced players ( eg better asset editor with more options) and the QoL is also mostly achieved through mods\\n- an AI that is more [u]A[/u] then [u]I[/u] (at some point it will eventually drive you insane)\\n\\nBut besides these negative things, the base game provides fun for at least 100 hours and thourgh additional content and mods a much higher playtime is granted. Also the positive aspects overwhelm the negative ones and through updates, many of the former problems where solved. So if anybody is struggleing with investing their money into this game I would recommend trying it out, waiting for a discount or just look up some gameplay on Youtube. I still enjoy playing this game and after some time, I had a feeling about which mods I need and which i want. And just like game like Minecraft, playing with mods is more fun, but if you play once a month or 3 times a year, its definitely not necessary.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Yeah it's a bit late for a review - but I'm glad I'm writing one now as had I written it at release it would have been full of praise as a must buy game...\\n\\nThing is, almost a year later this game still has a ton of irritating bugs that you absolutely must install mods for. I could deal with that - except the mods are poorly supported and very frequently break with patches leaving you with useless save games.\\n\\nI could even deal with that - if the patches that  the developer was putting out were fixing major issues. Thing is..they haven't. CO seems to have forgotten about the many annoyances of this game and been happy to let the modding community sort them out.\\n\\nUnfortunately it seems that many of the issues that this game suffers from just have not been adequately addressed by mods. Traffic is a complete nightmare with the AI behaving oddly and as such designing a high density city is incredibly tedious as you will spend 99% of your time fighting with traffic.\\n\\nOk - fine, we can say that the traffic is the core challenge of skylines as really beyond that the game is trivially simple - but even that turns into hours of frustration as the tools you have for building roads are amazingly clunky. Some of the most popular mods are ways of disabling pillars, road intersection angle limitations and slope limitations for roads - but even those mods are tedious to use as you have a very clunky interface for building roads and no built in teraforming tools. The mods that do exist are clunky to use or result in incredibly ugly and unrealistic looking roads.\\n\\nThese are all issues that have been listed from day one - so where are we a year later? Same place of course! CO has released a pair of unimpressive DLCs which are mostly cosmetic and at times annoying. After Dark does not add much except tunnels that is of any use and the night mode is just another layer of frustration as building at night is difficult - unless you get that mod that lights up your mouse cursor. Snowfall adds trams which are basically expensive buses with no other advantages that I can see - there is effectively no real reason to use them besides aesthetics as metro and buses get the job done better and easier.  Heated pipes offer little change in the game.\\n\\nSo here we are - a year later and the game still feels like it needs ~30 essential mods to enjoy and even that enjoyment is basically fighting with the road building system for 2 hours to build a single good looking and working highway off-ramp.\\n\\nI really want to love this game but every single time I play it I feel more drained and frustrated by it than my day job.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Like many players of Cities Skylines, I was a long time fan of SimCity, starting way back in the 90s. I was obsessed with games like SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4, so when 2013 came around, and a new SimCity was finally coming out, I was pretty excited. I had heard the negative press of course, the online connectivity, the rumored small city zones, but none the less, I was starved for a good modern city builder, so when launch day came, I was still excited. I ordered some Imo's Pizza, and then proceeded to wait 4 hours to even login to the SimCity servers. But once I did, I had a blissful city building experience. For two hours. After that, there was no room to build anything, and traffic was nightmare. But without an alternative, I kept playing anyway.\\n\\nFast forward a couple of years to 2015, with the imminent release of Cities Skylines. By now I was a bit wary of a new city builder. I had given up on the new SimCity and gone back to SimCity 4, but I was still hungry for something new, something modern, something with curved roads. [i]Curved. Roads.[/i] So I bought Cities Skylines, and I've never looked back. Now true, the game didn't have a lot of the same features as SimCity at launch. There were no disaster options, no day/night cycle, and the graphics were a little dull. But all of that has been added in or updated either with patches or new expansions, and whatever's still missing can be covered by the modding community, which is perpetually pumping out tons of amazing new assets to populate your cities with. The comparison to SimCity and Maxis couldn't be starker. Whereas one abandoned support for SimCity fairly quickly, Colossal Order with their continued and dedicated support for Cities Skylines has offered some of the best post-launch updates of really any game studio in the industry.\\n\\nWhile I do have to knock Skylines a bit for subpar music that doesn't hold a candle to the SimCity soundtrack, as far as everything else is concerned, this is the absolute best city builder on the market, and with so many expansions and updates, there's absolutely no reason not to give it a try!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I was an avid fan of the SimCity franchise all the way back to SimCity on SNES when Will Wright was the developer. I had my pet peeves with SimCity 4 and was very much so looking forward to SimCity 6 (2013) which ended up being an EXTREME disappointment and should have been called SimTown instead. I was finding myself completing a City in less than 2 hours, and got so frustrated with the game that I took to their Facebook page and left a rather lengthy post that hundreds of others seemed to share the same feelings in regards to the lack of attention put into the game.\\n\\nThen comes Cities: Skylines. My girlfriend actually purchased a copy for me as a gift and I had my eye on it for awhile, just never made the purchase because I didn't have time to play (full-time developer).\\n\\nI can honestly say this is everything that SimCity SHOULD have been, or at least what EA Games promised us it would be.\\n\\n-> [ Steam Workshop ]\\nThe steam workshop is the HUGE seller for me. Almost any building, tool and mod is available to integrate into the game. I have well over 200 addons packed into my game, and almost an endless supply of buildings I can place, which ensures my city doesn't look the same everywhere. This is probably my FAVORITE thing about the game, is the huge support for this game through the workshop.\\n\\n-> [ Detailed Building Tools ]\\nEverything from the terrain tools, the different types of roads you can place, and the ability to toggle the grid system on/off makes it possible to pretty much create anything you want. No two cities should look alike if you truly utilize the tools you are given.\\n\\n-> [ Sandbox Mode ]\\nWhen I play these simulators, I don't like going through and playing the scenarios and having to watch my money. This game gives me the ability to have an unlimited source of money, and just build away. \\n\\n-> [ Game Engine ]\\nEverything is beautiful in regards to the games appearance and performance. FPS is extremely smooth, and the entire city looks amazing (especially at night with the lights on). I haven't ran into any bugs, and I can pretty much crank the graphics up to ultra for everything, and the level of detail is very very real.\\n\\n-> [ Traffic ]\\nIt is relatively easy to control traffic in this game. You just have to map out where your dense traffic is going to be, and adjust accordingly with the right roads, and the other methods of transportation are great as well! (Bus, airport, tram, etc).\\n\\nI did find one minor annoyance. It appears that Sims get sick quite frequently, especially in a highly populated city. Theirs almost never a moment where I don't hear an ambulance screaming past me where I'm building.  In fact one time, I was just browsing the city, and one of my main busy roads had 17 ambulances one after another, going to different calls... that's a little excessive.... I don't even see them that much in Los Angeles...\\n\\nOverall, it's a great game, and definitely worth the price. I think the DLCs are a little over-priced for what they provide, but that's certainly not a reason to not buy the game.\\n\\nIt looks like EA Games is no longer the king of City Simulators.\\n\\nRegards,\\nRichard\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Over 300 hours enough said ALL PROBLEMS I LIST ARE FIXED BY MODS [/h1] \\n\\nDue to the new as of 7/11/17 mass transportion dlc a lot of the traffic issues I list are voided. \"Slightly\" Cars will plie up because the random cars not owned by people in the city are trying to use your city highway system as a short cut between highways connection: A and highway connection:B So you have either HAVE to make a bypass for those cars or your highways will be clogged. The new dlc does add more details to the cites transportation information screens. However not enough for example I recently started to use a lot of underground passages to make people have easy connection to schools or medical buildings. I see the many homes that people leave to use these tunnles but I do not know *HOW* many people are using them. \\n\\n\\nNighttime is nice. But the speciality of areas to section into your city seem lacking. However my biggest issue is no shock here. Taxis. I thought the taxis would work like buses jut spawning the needed amount for the area or route. Nope Taxis are a limited number. Making them nothing but flash for your roads and never making the expense money back. It seems that with more they add to the game the more the games traffic isses become more bothersome. Yes I can fix it with mods. However, I say I shouldnt have to. Because this game was made by the same dev that made City in motion. So clearly they have an understanding of what a city needs to run. However, they seem to have cut that out in this as in transport that has diffrent type of mass transport and effectivness in this game. The game seems to be designed for a road/highway based city. And any other methods bedamed. Which I personally find very not upset just wishing it was better. Tunnels add a new useful way to manage roads/highways. However the tunnels are not labeled so over time underground ends up looking like the L.A. freeways system but underground.Further there is not enough detailed information. Industry will complain about not having enough resources. However there is no way to just add the import costs to the city expenses. Which is very confusing because there are city view overlays that show trucks driving to industry with imports. It seems that over time the industries are not able to order more imports. This problem also effects office/commercial these sectors also lose the ability to get the goods needed to function. Moreover, If you connect industry to office/comm industry for a time sends the needed goods to the formerly mentioned sectors. Alas the mentioned issues mean that after a time the problems kick in so massive amounts of these sectors are abandoned. So you will have to delete large sections of those sectors. Moving on to transport it works by placing lines in the path you want it to go and press the  line to place the stop. That is how the game explains it to you however that it is very messy to place many lines on bus and trains/subway. Traffic is another big problem. And can not be fixed without placing messy lines of highway making your city look like the L.A. freeway system. Oh and the cars on the highway drive like shit cutting each other off and slowing down the other cars in the lanes. No matter how many subways or buses or trains I place in hotspots. People still use their cars. After playing the game for another 100+ hours my traffic controling skills are better so after about 90,000 people in my city THEN the trafic goes to poop. However this game is not marketed as a grand city builder just a basic one. So it shouldnt have taken me and extra 100 hours to get a handle on the traffic and mass transport. Moding is highly easy for this game I still find myself using very little \"big\" mods other than road intersections and what not because heavy mods make my game crash.  [h1] ALL PROBLEMS i LISTED ARE FIXED BY MODS, STILL BETTER THAN SIMCITY5 !!![/h1]',\n",

       "  'review': \"I've played a lot of city builders in my time but I can honestly say that City Skylines is the city builder game that I have waited years for. It's such a smooth game to play. It runs like a throughly tested, well polished game. The vibrant colors and excellent soundtrack in the game instantly puts me in the mood to build my dream city. The game tools provides one with an abundance of creativity. So much so that I felt overwhelmed with all that I am able to do. I'm only limited by my imagination not the game mechanics which is awesome! Some of my favorite aspects of the game is the simulated people, yes folks each little pixlated person is an indivisual in City Skylines! I love the water dynamics and how they can create a challenge which adds to gameplay and not take away from it. I love all of the transportation options with more types promised in the future. I love the soundtrack and if I had only one regret, it was not getting in on that pre-order offer to get it.  But what I love most, is the potential of this game through the modding community. This game is built with modding in mind. Can you imaging the many props and gameplay mods that will flow from the talented modders for this game? I can hardly wait, and guess what? The modders are already making assets and gamemods for Cities as you read this. I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you are interested in City Builders and you've been burned by other games, look no further. Cities will most likely satisfy everything you've ever wanted in a city builder game. I whole heartily reccommend City Skylines.  :)\",\n",

There is so much you can do.\\nPro and con: I feel the game is mostly about traffic and managing which I like, some may not.\\nCon: fps drops significantly at high populations. But what bothers me more is these weird long pauses that all vehicles (trains, cars, taxis, trams, metros) take after they initiate an action. I guess simulations of >100k vehicles really slows the game down even though fps is at 30.\\n\\nUpdate: Ruined by expensive DLCs that don't add real content to the game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Another city building game, but it\\'s not quite like the others.  More on that later, first my list of pros and cons;\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\n- Water has current, which you have to plan for so as not to polute your own shores.\\n- Water can controlled, both current and levels using hydro dams.\\n- Citizens have specifically assigned residences (and jobs), making traffic more realistic.\\n- The various interface overlays makes determining the placing of utility structures very easy.\\n- You can practically do anything you want to when it comes to roads/highways/ramps.\\n- Graphics are superb and performance is amazing, regardless of zoom level.\\n- You get the feeling of SimCity, without the bad taste it left behind.\\n- Completely customizable routes for buses, subways, and trains.\\n- High number of road types for you to select, everything from gravel to highways.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n- Constant \"tweets\" got pretty annoying after a while.\\n- Tweets about problems that shouldn\\'t exist (ex. dead person, with a crematorium next door).\\n- Building with full fire coverage would burn down and prompt you to check fire coverage.\\n- Not enough options to deal with garbage and collection ranges seemed unrealistic.\\n- A lot of specialty buildings had \"noise\" zones that seemed unreasonably large.\\n- No real options to deal with industry polution, other than to keep it away from everything else.\\n- Not enough random building names, I\\'d often find 6-8 buildings in a row with the same name.\\n- Small number of maps included (although more are available).\\n- No way (that I\\'ve found) to have a subway come to the surface.\\n- No streetcars\\n- Ships (cruise/cargo) movement seemed extremely unrealistic, as if it was an afterthought.\\n- Music is EXTREMELY repetative, I had to turn it off after a while.\\n- Road \"snapping\" can be annoying when working on highway offramps, even when it\\'s supposedly turned off.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve given you that basic list, let\\'s get down to brass tax.  Everyone is correct when they say that this game is everything that SimCity should have been.  That said, it is lacking in a few basics that SimCity actually had.  The biggest thing in my list of pet peves for this game would have to be garbage collection.  In my 80,000 population city (real life) there is one garbage dump and the entire city\\'s garbage has been going there since the city was built.  In this game, by the time my population was 10,000 I had 4 garbage dumps spread out across the landscape.  By the time I hit 80,000 there was an entire district devoted to garbage dumps (10 of them) with 6 insinerators trying (unsuccessfully) to keep them from being full.  I even had the recycling policy in place, and still my garbage dumps were overflowing.  Oh, that\\'s another thing, no recycling centers?\\n\\nAnyway, when you put this game beside SimCity there really isn\\'t any question that Cities: Skylines is the superior game overall.  It does have it\\'s issues, but it\\'s by far the best all around city building game that\\'s been produced.  Don\\'t go into this game expecting your every city building dream to come true, just enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nSince the addition of the Workshop to Cities:Skylines most of the problems I mentioned are easily solved by downloading 3rd party workshop items, like a recycling center.  This game is now my #1 city building game.',\n",

In effect, Paradox is attempting to hijack our computer systems, our software use data, and who knows what other data through this launcher action.\\n\\nTo quote Tony Stark to Nick Fury in The Avengers:\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry, Nick.

       "  'review': \"Best City Building Game Ever.  \\n\\nIf you don't like paying for DLCs, don't buy them.  With all the mods and assets (for free, by the way) on Workshop for this game, the DLC's are not at all necessary.  I've been playing this game for years now (2,496 hours at the time of this review) and have never been bored once.  And the only DLC I ever bought was AFTER DARK …. only because it gave me bicycle lanes.  I've felt no desire to purchase the Disasters or the Mass Transit DLCs, even if they were dropped to $1.00 each ….. okay, maybe the Mass Transit one if only $1.00.\\n  \\nBut I've gotten off-track of my point, which is that with all the mods and assets that are free for this game, you don't really need the DLCs.\\n\\nIf you just subscribe (it's free) to the First Person Mod by Tony56a, you can have days and weeks of fun just traveling around in your city.  As a Cim yourself or just riding along in a vehicle or a Cim wherever they go.  The game is COMPLETEY DIFFERENT – and sooo much fun – once you jump down into it and actually look at it from ground level.\\n\\nFrustrated with creating a city?  Don't bother to create one --- on the Workshop, you can subscribe to a city of your choice (again, for free) that is already all set up for you, mods and assets, roads, city services, and all, and immediately start playing about down in the city as a CIM yourself.  Or you can start from there (with all the frustrating work of setting things up) already done for you.  From that point you can play with what you subscribed to or start adding in or removing anything you like from the city.\\n\\nAnyone who hasn't tried this game is cheating himself/herself of one of the most fascinating experiences ever …. and I gotta tell ya, NO ONE could get me to play ANY computer games before I was forced by a family member to sit down in front of this one for one hour and play it.  Now I'm hooked and spend almost all my spare winter season hours on it  …  and, to my shame, some of my summer gardening hours as well.\\n\\nAnd, honestly, for a vacation into a world you can make into your very own, the initial price is more than worth it.  If I lost it and had to start over and buy it again, I'd actually be willing to save up till I had $60.00 US and buy it again, if that was what it cost then.  And really, all anyone ever really has to pay for is the initial game, regardless of what the naysayers are whining about.\",\n",

It's a creative outlet for those who like to create worlds as well as those who like to create things found in the worlds like 3D artists and those who like to code. This sandbox game leaves it up to your imagination to create whatever you want when it comes to building cities. And it is surrounded by a great community. I highly recommend this game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I feel very rude and it frustrates me to write this, but I do not recommend Cities: Skylines unless it is at a good sale price. \\n\\nI love simulation games, but this one grew stale and was not for me.\\n\\nThe first several hours were really enjoyable and I even went as far as to get the After Dark DLC at a sale price since I anticipated I\\'d be addicted. But only a few hours later did I realize I wasn\\'t enjoying the game anymore. There are no \"scenarios\" to play, adding actual goals to the game, unless you get the Natural Disasters DLC (and there are apparently very few). You\\'re just left to endlessly build a city with intricate micromanagement. If that sounds like your type of game, buy it! If that\\'s all you want, this game will be perfect.\\n\\nMy major complaints that led to me stop enjoying the game began with the lack of customization. For the first while, before your city\\'s population adds up and you unlock more features, there\\'s not much to add personalization to your city to make it feel like your own. Different types of roads and other customizations are blocked off arbitrarily in the early portion of building a city, and you\\'ll only get access to these by boosting your population by a stated amount. It makes sense! It really does, but it made the first hour or two of starting a new city absolutely boring. I feel the game would have benefitted from loosening these restrictions.\\n\\n... and to follow that up, you may say \"there are mods, though!\" Yes, there are, and I was very excited to try them. However, the community proves that there are troubles with every update. Mods become incompatible, unsupported by the developers, and as a new player, lots of research will go into finding out how to use these mods and have them appear in your game, like custom buildings or styles. Many times, just trying to make sure custom content appeared in the in-game \"Content Manager\" would crash the game just after a few items. I thought it was just because I originally ran the game on an external hard drive, but I eventually tried it on my internal SSD, and the mods just seemed to hamper the game.\\n\\nIf you have a lot of patience to learn the sciene behind the custom content of the game, and don\\'t mind the aimless city-building with not much else to look forward to but \"more, more and more\". This is a sandbox game for you, no question.\\n \\nI understand why some people like it, but after the amount of time I played, I just feel exhausted and need a long break. The pleasure of growing my city sort of numbed itself.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I love strategic and economic games, simulation games. This is by far the best game I've ever played. It will take a lot of hours to get to know the game better. The game is not simple, as it seems at first. If you do not think over the details, you can immediately go bankrupt and go into a minus and loans. Everything in the game is interconnected, one without the other does not exist. In the game you should not forget to build power stations, water supply systems and, most importantly, build roads thoroughly. One action can easily ditch the city by raising the water level in the wrong place or put a refinery near the pumping station. A big plus is the animation in the game. In the evenings, the lanterns are beautifully lit, and in the morning the sun is brightly reflected in the windows of high-rise buildings. A sufficient number of amenities, social and city services make the game rich, it is always pleasant to build a park and educational institution and see how the level of welfare of the district increases. A huge minus, which is terribly annoying - this is traffic ... I don’t try to increase the speed on the roads, delete extra dorgas, make rounds, roads are still loaded, and this worsens the work of all city services. It is also a frequent problem - they cannot take out corpses from houses, although there are a lot of cemeteries and crematoria. I still do not understand why this happens even on free roads. I recommend the game, for more understanding in the Internet games there are many guidelines.\",\n",

Yea this is basicly that but not a huge disapointment. \\n\\nI have been playing simcity for many years, and I am sure that I am not the only one that was very unpelased with simcity 2013. Was it horrible? Nah, but it was not as good as it should be. \\n\\nCities Skylines is the modern city builder I have been looking for. No city restrictions and no online DRM BS. The game allows you to build insansly large cities, and the modding community is already pushing out some really cool stuff, especialy with the asset and map editor being a thing.  \\n\\nIt does not have the same kind of quarkyness that simcity has, and wont have the same kind of random events, but it is satisfying to watch the city grow.\\n\\nMy only real problem with the game is that it does not tailor it's self way to new players. If you are new to the city building genre then be prepared to fail a lot, as this game will punish you for the smallest of mistakes. \\n\\nIf you are like me and been wanting a great modern version of simcity then this is for you, along with the modding community I would definetly say that this game is well worth 30 bucks.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"In a nutshell: the company that publishes the game (Paradox) is getting painfuly close to EA/Ubisoft in how they run their business, if not even worse.\\n\\nTheir DLC approach is absolutely atrocious. EU4/CK2 have each got a couple dozen DLCs over the years with a combined price of soon-to-hit-300$, expect this game to drown in a dozen (quite possibly incompatible with each other) DLCs as well.\\n\\nBesides that, Paradox has increased (up to 100% increase in some regions) prices in many regions without any announcement beforehand, right before the Steam Summer Sale 2017.\\n\\nIf you're willing to throw some of your money away and are willing to indulge Paradox in their cupidity, go ahead. Otherwise, steer very well clear of any of their products, especially their Gra*DLC MISSING*egies.\",\n",

       "  'review': '\"Wait a second\", you might say, \"this gal has 750+ hours in Cities:Skylines. Why doesn\\'t she recommend it? What\\'s wrong with it?\"\\n\\nLet me get this straight: The *game* is amazing. I\\'d wholeheartedly recommend it to you, because it gave me hours of fun, relaxing and on times challenging gameplay. It did everything SimCity promised but didn\\'t follow through, and it has a phenomenal community to boost. I own the game and all DLC on PC, I own the game on Switch and I even own the board game. That\\'s how much I love the game.\\n\\nBut: Paradox (and I\\'m pretty certain this was Paradox\\'s idea) had to force another Launcher application on us. A Launcher that (as of writing this review) adds no useful functionality to the game for us gamers. And to make matters worse, their community management resorts to being everything from defensive about it to being outright toxic towards their customer base. They keep telling us it\\'s beneficial to us and doesn\\'t spy on us. Network Analysis Tools beg to differ. This launcher connects to not fewer than four servers. They harvest data, without your consent, and they\\'re intransparent and defensive about it.\\n\\nAt the moment it pains me to say: Don\\'t buy the game.',\n",

(HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EXITS BEING ON THAT SIDE)\\n\\n\\nThose are the biggest game breaking bugs in the game but lets go to the head scratchers.\\n\\nYou can put the taxes up to 29% but everyone is going to complain and as far as i know its not possible to go more than 18% even if the land value is up the roof and everyone is happy.\\n\\nYour citizens will always complain.\\n\\nWater physics, yea they don\\'t exist and dont get me started on building a hydro power plant, just dont do it or you will 100% drown your city because water is wet and dogs say woof.\\n\\n\\nNow to the performance part.\\n\\nThe graphics are MEH compared to Sim City but for some reason the game runs slower, I believe it\\'s becuase of bad optimization but im not sure, Im not alone with this problem as alot of other people are having the same issues even though they have better PC\\'s than me.\\n\\nI start to suffer at a population of 20k with a maximum of 50 fps\\nAnd at a population of 400k thats when we are talking 20 fps max\\n\\nNot will you just take a performance hit but the time will go slower and progress will \"stall\" \\n(It won\\'t actually stall but it will take longer for stuff to respond to the changes you\\'ve made)\\n\\nMy setup: i5-6600k (3.50GHz) with a Sapphire RX480 Nitro+ (4GB) with 16 GB of LPX Vengance RAM (3200MHz)\\n\\n\\nSo to wrap this up by saying, this is just a tiny portion of the bugs i\\'ve encountered but there still is alot more but these bugs stand out the most to me, Would i recommend this game, at the current price HECK NO, but i would recommend waiting for a discount then get it i guess, but only if you\\'re ready to face everything i\\'ve mentioned and alot more.\\n\\nEDIT: I was wrong, it wasn\\'t just 40€+ it was \\'79,91€ Add all DLC to Cart\\'',\n",

At the time I got this game, which as some time ago, I was a Simcity fan, well I still am. Not as much since the disaster of Simcity 2015. I was intrigued when I saw Cities: Skylines, I saw good potential. I took the risk of buying it, not doing much research about it, sure enough, I picked the right game.\\n\\n[h1]Cities: Skylines vs Simcity[/h1]\\n\\nCities: Skylines is basically Simcity, but even better. You can put in so much detail in your cities. Managing traffic without any care will also lead yourself into bigger problems than what Simcity would do, well for me at least.\\n\\nYou have your modes such as the original, you have to manage your money, and have to be smart on your spendings to make the income to keep yourself afloat. Then you have The Sandbox, which is the only one I play, to be honest. You don't have to worry about anything, really. Well, your city of course, but money isn't much of an issue.\\n\\nYou have your utilities to supply your city. Such as Water, Electricity, and Sewage and so on.\\n\\nYou place down your zones, such as Low-Residental, High-Residental, Commerical, Business, and Industry.\\n\\nYou have your transportation, although not all are included, as yes, DLC's. But the DLC's are kind of worth it, I'll explain more about this later. Anyways, you have your Subway System, Train System, Airplanes, and Buses.\\n\\nYou supply happiness to your city, placing their wants and needs. Build a park to make your city look more beautiful, put in school systems so your citizens actually have a good education for better jobs.\\n\\n[h1]The Downloadable Content (DLC)[/h1]\\n\\nThe Downloadable content for this game is actually pretty good,  although some are bad in my opinion. But these DLC' add's more to your games. The DLC's I would focus on getting first would be these:\\n\\n[b]- Green Cities\\n- Mass Transit\\n- Natural Disasters\\n- Snowfall\\n- After Dark.[/b]\\n\\nEach of these DLC's will add more to your game. For example, with After Dark, you'll be able to add some nightlife in your city, or with Mass Transit you'll have better transportation. \\n\\nIt's good and bad for the DLC's, you just have to pay more to experience more, but in a way, it's sort of worth it if you're dedicated to playing this game. I'll likely review these, later on, in the meantime, I don't have any of them reviewed.\\n\\n[h1]Is there mod support?[/h1]\\n\\nOh yes, there is indeed Mod Support. a very good amount too. It's also easy to use them also because all you need is the Steam Workshop!\\n\\nYou can have some enhanced mods, such as AI improvements, buildings, and more! Just also note, some DLC's are required for some mods. Usually, the creators will give out the requirements needed for the mod, but other than that you should be okay.\\n\\nSteam Workshop Link: https://steamcommunity.com/app/255710/workshop/\\n\\n[i]Note: Putting mods in your game is risking your city to no longer work after updates with outdated mods. Use at your own risk, this issue has happened to me several times.[/i]\\n\\n[h1]My Final Thoughts[/h1]\\n\\nIf you want a good city building of a game, Cities: Skylines is a perfect pick for you 101%! There's so much you can do in this game for a city builder, more than what Simcity had in the past. Using mods is although risky, but it really, really enhances your game so much more.\\n\\nOn a final rating of a scale 1/10, I would give this game a 9.4/10!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Cities: Skylines received many praise due to EA's Sim Cities being a failed game. If Sim Cities was better, this game would have been shunned by the most part of it. People are giving this game way too much credit.\\n   To begin with, the vanilla game by its self is mediocre at best. The gameplay is okay but the vanilla textures are an eye sore. And half the texture are just reused from their older, more transportation based game, Cities in Motion. Sure it maybe a good idea to reuse but the textures just don't look all that great. People really give this game so much credit because of the mods, not the vanilla game. But the more mods you have, the slower the game runs thus having to limit your mod intake. \\n   I bought this game when it was only $16.99. Once the developers saw the profits they were making, they raised the price on us, an EA move. Once they saw we bought their first two DLC's, they began to create more and focus less on giving us free updates. Half of the DLC content should have already been in the game. A day and Night cycle, above-ground metros, season, etc. \\n   I'm just saying, the game used to be worth it when it only cost half of what it was. If you do buy it remember, you are really only paying for a quarter of the game, keep in mind that EA... I mean Paradox Development Studios just wants your money.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Well this game is a strange one. To sum it up: If you only want to design a nice looking city you'll probably like this game. But if you want to build a city and to deal with challenging problems in this city you'll probably be bored very soon, because the game mechanics are too simple and not challenging at all. In my point of view this is mainly caused by the following issues:\\n[list]\\n [*]Traffic: Probably the only challenging problem within your city. It's ok or even a little bit too low within downtown but much too high in industrial districts. Furthermore traffic jams are often caused by the stupid AI. You'll spend much time optimizing it by building additional roads, railroads, bus lines and so on. But then again - there are almost no penalities for having a bad traffic system. Only if the traffic becomes too bad growables won't get enough resources, which again causes your citizens to abandon them.\\n [*]Pollution: It has only a range of one or two blocks around your industrial areas. You only may not build residentals in this area. If you do so you'll never have any problems with pollution in your city.\\n [*]Energy: You can build several different powerplants. Which ones you'll choose is almost completely irrelevant and just a matter of MW per $. For example: There aren't any calms, so it isn't risky powering your city with only wind energy. Coal energy generates much pollution, but then again pollution only has a range of one or two blocks. . . . . .\\n [*]City-Services (Crime/ Fire/ Health/ Education/ Deathcare/ Leisure/ Garbage): Just build one of these buildings here and there and your growables will be all happy. There's almost no need for a clever placement of those buildings.\\n [*]Growables: Achieving the highest levels for all of your growables is easy, because the level mainly depends on the amount of city services, which are in the neighborhood of this building. \\n [*]Tourism: It is still completely broken. You cannot focus on tourism, because there are never enough tourists visiting your city.\\n [*]Resource chain and industrial production: They are also very simple. Basic resources (oil, food, ore) are transformed into general goods which are transported to your commercials and then bought by your citizens. You cannot specialize into anything, like car industry or hightech industry, here.\\n[*]Zoning: You almost don't need any strategy for placing your zones well or choosing a good ratio. Just avoid building too much industrials because of the traffic jams and your city probably will be fine. There's almost no variety like ways of specialization here. So appending new blocks to your city becomes pretty boring after a while.\\n[*] Income: You will never know how well your city works, since this game automatically tries to adjust the tax income of your growables, so that your total net income is somewhere between 10 000 $ or 20 000 $. This adjustment only fails if your expenses are much too high.\\n[*] Disasters: Not really available in this game. There are just fires. They don't even spread and only destroy a single building if the fire fighters don't arrive fast enough.\\n[/list]\\nI could still continue with this list for a while. But at least in my view the above mentioned flaws within the game mechanics are the most important ones. So I'll stop here. There are also some minor issues with the graphics (scales of growables are wrong) and with the GUI (placing roads and bus lines often becomes tedious). But I could easily forgive those issues if the basic game mechanics were better.\",\n",

Initially there is only a limited selection for you to play with. As your population grows more tools become available and the pacing is just perfect.\\n\\nFeatures like global policies that can reduce power consumption or increase fire safety are introduced at a rate that never feels like a bombardment. The same goes for buildings and services. Rather than a sit down and read endless pop-ups style tutorial features are gradually introduced so that only small explanations are needed at each stage. It really lets you get hooked even during those often tedious early learning stages. Another reason Skylines is so fun straight from the start is that each and every tool you use is so effortless.\\n\\nThere’s a zone system used that is very similar to everyone’s favourite Sim City game. But again the tools are there for you to make your life easy. Streets come ready equipped with grids attached that you can either paint one square at a time, use a paint brush tool or even a fill tool to create entire blocks easily. Then waiting just a little time everything comes to life as buildings are erected and citizens go about their daily lives.\\n\\nAll this simplicity isn’t to imply that Skylines isn’t complex. Underneath the user friendly interface there are a set of menus and tables that reveal some of the numbers that lie beneath. Finances, happiness, healthcare, education, crime and transport are all detailed enough to make Skylines worthy of any city building fan.\\n\\nThe only thing that some may not like is the slightly sandbox style, especially later in the game.

But after the initial wow factor, I am finding it rather shallow in terms of challenge.  There are a lot of tax tweaking options but i\\'ve never had to touch them, I have a very healthy income whatever I do.  Where are the problems faced by mayors?  People are asking for help on how to get the crime rate above 50% achievement - this shouldn\\'t be something people need help with, it should be easy to make happen just through bad city management.  I wish my doctors would go on strike, or that a riot would happen, or that schools demanded a bigger budget.  Even the wind reducing a bit during certain seasons would give me a challenge because my city is powered 100% by clean wind power.  Skylines just makes running a city seem too easy.\\n\\nI hope this initial release is kind of a \"here it is, be creative and build things\" and that future expansions will add some extra layers that start to challenge us.',\n",

       "  'review': \"One of the best city building games of all time in my opinion. I've gotten more time out of this than Simcity as a whole (in the same span of time) and I still love it. Great workshop compatibility, graphics, and mechanics. Some things could definitely be improved but I feel like the workshop is already on all of that. WAY better than any other equivalent. Also, I can't believe this game is made in Unity! Doesn't run that well on larger cities but is still runs better than any other city builder. It actually simulates everthing, the roads are way better, huge maps, resources, much better traffic AI than other games (not to say that you can just draw grids everywhere and not expect traffic, you still have to use a 6-4-2 method). Roads tools are great and fun and aesthatically appealing.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Its been said before; if you liked the sim city games, then this is for you\\nI played sim city 4, and wasn't blown away with it, like I am with this game\\nThere is so much you can do, but essentially, this is a traffic management simulator. You start off with 1 square and a small amount of money to get your city started, at first it can be difficult to supply all the services required for your new residents. I advise watching beginners guide youtube videos as you can get into debt pretty quickly if you overspend\\nAfter 200 hours of game play, I have lost count of how many times i have restarted my city, and have yet to build a megapolis (100,000 cims), not only because of getting into debt, but wanting to bulldoze everything and redesign my city! I have got to the point where I force myself to not destroy my residents homes for a new bypass to a new neighbourhood, but instead try to upgrade the existing infrastructure, as if it was a real city.\\nWhen I first got the game 2 years ago, the vanilla game was missing a lot of features, but with the dlcs, they have added a lot of the popular mods into the base game, I still run a few mods (namely traffic president and move it) to help increase the realism\\nThis game and its soundtrack is very relaxing, I can play four hours without realising, and in that time all I have done is build a big custom park. I have found that detailing is everything, it makes your city look more natural, rather than boring grids everywhere\\n\\nTL:DR \\nIf you liked sim city, buy cities: skylines. If you can get the base game and mods at discount, even better!\",\n",
